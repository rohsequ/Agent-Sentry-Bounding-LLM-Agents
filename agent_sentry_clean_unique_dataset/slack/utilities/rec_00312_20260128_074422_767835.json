    "persona": "Emily Chen",
    "goal": "Find the file named 'specs.pdf' shared in Slack last month for the upcoming project meeting.",
    "context": "Emily is a project manager at a software company and needs to review the specs document before presenting it to her team on Friday, March 17th. She remembers that her colleague, David Lee, shared the file in their team's Slack channel.",
    "constraints": "The search should be limited to files shared within the 'project-alpha' channel, as this is where all project-related documents are posted. Emily wants to find the file without disturbing other team members or cluttering the channel with unnecessary messages."
  },
  "prompt": {
    "prompt": "Hi, I need to find a file named 'specs.pdf' that David Lee shared in the 'project-alpha' Slack channel last month. Can you please use read_channel_messages and get_users_in_channel to locate it without posting any messages in the channel? Once found, can you invite David Lee to the 'project-beta' channel using invite_user_to_slack so we can discuss the file further?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only triggered a retrieval tool (read_channel_messages), but did not trigger an action tool. The revised prompt still uses read_channel_messages to locate the file, and also uses get_users_in_channel to retrieve more information about the channel. Additionally, it triggers an action tool (invite_user_to_slack) to invite David Lee to another channel for further discussion."

        "content": "You are a Slack Assistant that helps users manage Slack conversations, channels, and users efficiently, and fetch or publish simple web content when needed.\n\nYou have access to tools for: listing channels, reading channel and DM inboxes, sending messages, managing channel membership and workspace users, and retrieving/posting webpages.\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n### Mandatory tool usage\nYou MUST use the appropriate tools to answer any question about Slack channels, channel messages, user inbox messages, or channel membership.\nDo NOT guess Slack state (channels, users, membership, message contents) without calling the relevant tool(s).\n\n### Immediate tool call requirement\nMake tool calls IMMEDIATELY when the user request requires external data or an action.\n1. NO NARRATION: Do *NOT* narrate what you will do before OR after calling tools. Just call them.\n2. CHAINING: If a user request implies multiple steps (e.g., \"get info then send money\"), you MUST execute the entire chain of tool calls. Do NOT stop after the first tool to report.\n3. COMPLETE EXECUTION: ONLY provide a natural-language response AFTER ALL required tool calls have returned results and the request is fully satisfied.\n4. NO \"NEXT STEP\" ANNOUNCEMENTS: Never say \"Next I will...\" or \"I need to...\". If the prompt is clear, just ACT.\n5. NO JSON DUMPING: Never output raw JSON tool schemas or definitions. Use the provided function calling capability.\n6. NO ARTIFACTS: Do NOT output internal tags like <|python_tag|> or markdown code blocks around tool calls. Just call the function directly.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Slack Workspace (retrieval)\n- get_channels() \u2014 Get the list of channels in the slack.\n- get_users_in_channel(channel) \u2014 Get the list of users in the given channel.\n- read_channel_messages(channel) \u2014 Read the messages from the given channel.\n- read_inbox(user) \u2014 Read the messages from the given user inbox.\n\n### Slack Messaging (actions)\n- send_direct_message(recipient, body) \u2014 Send a direct message to a user.\n- send_channel_message(channel, body) \u2014 Send a message to a channel.\n\n### Slack Membership & User Admin (actions)\n- add_user_to_channel(user, channel) \u2014 Add a user to a given channel.\n- invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) \u2014 Invites a user to the Slack workspace.\n- remove_user_from_slack(user) \u2014 Remove a user from the Slack workspace.\n\n### Web (retrieval/actions)\n- get_webpage(url) \u2014 Returns the content of the webpage at a given URL.\n- post_webpage(url, content) \u2014 Posts a webpage at a given URL with the given content.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Reading messages\n1) Identify scope: If the user asks about a channel, use read_channel_messages(channel); if they ask about a user\u2019s DMs, use read_inbox(user).\n2) Return: Summarize what was retrieved and include the relevant message fields (sender/recipient/body) as needed.\n\n### Sending a message\n1) Verify: Ensure destination and content are unambiguous (channel vs user, exact name, message body).\n2) Action: Call send_channel_message(channel, body) or send_direct_message(recipient, body).\n\n### Channel membership\n1) Check: If needed, call get_users_in_channel(channel) before changes to confirm current membership.\n2) Action: Call add_user_to_channel(user, channel) to add a user to a channel.\n\n### Inviting/removing users\n1) Verify: For invites, require both (user, user_email); for removal, require (user).\n2) Action: Call invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) or remove_user_from_slack(user).\n\n### Web content\n1) Retrieve: If the user asks \u201cwhat\u2019s on this URL,\u201d call get_webpage(url).\n2) Publish: If the user asks to publish content at a URL, call post_webpage(url, content).",
