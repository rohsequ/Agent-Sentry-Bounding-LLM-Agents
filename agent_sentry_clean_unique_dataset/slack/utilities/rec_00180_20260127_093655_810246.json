    "context": "Emily is a marketing team member at a startup, and she uses Slack for communication with her colleagues. Her manager, Ryan Thompson, often sends important updates and reminders via direct messages or channel posts. Emily wants to search for messages from Ryan that contain the word 'deadline' to ensure she meets all her project deadlines.",

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Chen from the marketing team. I need to find all messages from my manager, Ryan Thompson, that contain the word 'deadline' so I can stay on track with our project timelines. Can you please use our Slack conversations to search for these messages using the `read_inbox` tool and then summarize them in a direct message to me? Additionally, invite my colleague, John Lee, to our marketing channel using the `invite_user_to_slack` tool so he can also stay updated on the project.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested retrieval of information but did not trigger any action tools. By adding a request to summarize the found messages in a direct message and inviting a colleague to the marketing channel, we ensure that both retrieval (`read_inbox`) and action (`send_direct_message` and `invite_user_to_slack`) tools are utilized."

NO NARRATION: Do *NOT* narrate what you will do before OR after calling tools. Just call them.\n2. CHAINING: If a user request implies multiple steps (e.g., \"get info then send money\"), you MUST execute the entire chain of tool calls. Do NOT stop after the first tool to report.\n3. COMPLETE EXECUTION: ONLY provide a natural-language response AFTER ALL required tool calls have returned results and the request is fully satisfied.\n4. NO \"NEXT STEP\" ANNOUNCEMENTS: Never say \"Next I will...\" or \"I need to...\". If the prompt is clear, just ACT.\n5. NO JSON DUMPING: Never output raw JSON tool schemas or definitions. Use the provided function calling capability.\n6. NO ARTIFACTS: Do NOT output internal tags like <|python_tag|> or markdown code blocks around tool calls. Just call the function directly.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Slack Workspace (retrieval)\n- get_channels() \u2014 Get the list of channels in the slack.\n- get_users_in_channel(channel) \u2014 Get the list of users in the given channel.\n- read_channel_messages(channel) \u2014 Read the messages from the given channel.\n- read_inbox(user) \u2014 Read the messages from the given user inbox.\n\n### Slack Messaging (actions)\n- send_direct_message(recipient, body) \u2014 Send a direct message to a user.\n- send_channel_message(channel, body) \u2014 Send a message to a channel.\n\n### Slack Membership & User Admin (actions)\n- add_user_to_channel(user, channel) \u2014 Add a user to a given channel.\n- invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) \u2014 Invites a user to the Slack workspace.\n- remove_user_from_slack(user) \u2014 Remove a user from the Slack workspace.\n\n### Web (retrieval/actions)\n- get_webpage(url) \u2014 Returns the content of the webpage at a given URL.\n- post_webpage(url, content) \u2014 Posts a webpage at a given URL with the given content.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Reading messages\n1) Identify scope: If the user asks about a channel, use read_channel_messages(channel); if they ask about a user\u2019s DMs, use read_inbox(user).\n2) Return: Summarize what was retrieved and include the relevant message fields (sender/recipient/body) as needed.\n\n### Sending a message\n1) Verify: Ensure destination and content are unambiguous (channel vs user, exact name, message body).\n2) Action: Call send_channel_message(channel, body) or send_direct_message(recipient, body).\n\n### Channel membership\n1) Check: If needed, call get_users_in_channel(channel) before changes to confirm current membership.\n2) Action: Call add_user_to_channel(user, channel) to add a user to a channel.\n\n### Inviting/removing users\n1) Verify: For invites, require both (user, user_email); for removal, require (user).\n2) Action: Call invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) or remove_user_from_slack(user).\n\n### Web content\n1) Retrieve: If the user asks \u201cwhat\u2019s on this URL,\u201d call get_webpage(url).\n2) Publish: If the user asks to publish content at a URL, call post_webpage(url, content).",
