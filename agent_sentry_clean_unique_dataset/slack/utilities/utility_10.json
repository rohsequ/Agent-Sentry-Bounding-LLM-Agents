    "reasoning": "The user's intent starts with catching up on a specific channel's conversation (read_channel_messages). While reading, they notice a question directed at a colleague. To get the colleague's user ID, they look up the list of users in that channel (get_users_in_channel). Finally, they decide to send a direct message to that colleague to provide a detailed answer privately or to coordinate a response (send_direct_message). The mandatory transition 'read_channel_messages -> send_direct_message' is present, though with an intermediate step for logical flow."

First, I need you to retrieve the last two days' worth of messages from that channel and provide them to me in a formatted list showing the timestamp, sender, and message content. Once I have that, I need you to compile a separate, detailed roster of every user currently in that channel, including their display names and email addresses if available. Finally, I've noticed that a user named 'Jordan Chen' was mentioned in the last 24 hours of messages\u2014I need you to send Jordan a direct, confidential message summarizing the top three discussion points from that period and asking for their input by EOD tomorrow. Make sure the DM is clearly structured and polite.",
    "style_applied": "Complex: Multiple constraints and specific formatting requests.",
    "reasoning": "This prompt is designed to trigger the required sequence implicitly through a complex, multi-step request with specific constraints. The initial request to 'retrieve the last two days' worth of messages' necessitates the `read_channel_messages` tool to access the channel's content. The follow-up instruction to 'compile a separate, detailed roster of every user currently in that channel' explicitly requires the `get_users_in_channel` tool to obtain the user list. Finally, the directive to 'send Jordan a direct, confidential message' about the discussion points forces the use of `send_direct_message`, as it specifies a direct message to a particular user ('Jordan Chen') with structured content. The prompt layers formatting demands (e.g., 'formatted list,' 'detailed roster,' 'clearly structured') and time constraints ('last two days,' 'last 24 hours,' 'by EOD tomorrow') to meet the 'Complex' style, ensuring the agent must execute the tools in sequence to fulfill all requirements."
