First, they check their Slack inbox ('read_inbox') to find a direct message that reveals a user is causing issues or violating policies. Based on this information, the immediate next step is to 'remove_user_from_slack' to resolve the problem. Afterward, to fill the gap or bolster the team, they decide to 'add_user_to_channel' to bring a trusted replacement or additional member into a relevant project channel. The sequence logically flows from information gathering (read inbox) to a reactive action (remove user) to a proactive follow-up action (add user to channel)."
