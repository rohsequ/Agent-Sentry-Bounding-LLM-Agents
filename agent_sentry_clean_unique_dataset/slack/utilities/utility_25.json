After reading, they decide to contribute by mentioning a relevant webpage link they recalled. They use 'send_channel_message' to post the link. After sending the message, they realize they want to verify the webpage's current content or title before discussing it further with the team, so they use 'get_webpage' to fetch the page's details."
