    "goal": "Find all messages from her manager, John Lee, containing the word 'deadline' to ensure she meets all upcoming project milestones.",
    "context": "Emily is a marketing specialist at a mid-sized company. She uses Slack for team communication and collaboration. It's currently Wednesday, March 15th, and Emily wants to review all important deadlines before the end of the quarter (March 31st).",
    "constraints": "The search should only include messages sent by John Lee in their shared marketing channel (#marketing-team) within the last 30 days (since February 12th). Emily has permission to read messages in the #marketing-team channel."
  },
  "prompt": {
    "prompt": "Hey, I need to review all messages from John Lee in the #marketing-team channel that contain the word 'deadline' and were sent between February 12th and now. Can you please retrieve those messages for me and then send a direct message to John Lee summarizing the deadlines mentioned?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested retrieval of information, which led to the agent only calling read_channel_messages and read_inbox tools. To fix this issue and trigger an action tool, the revised prompt asks the agent not just to retrieve the messages but also to send a direct message to John Lee summarizing the deadlines found in those messages. This addition requires the agent to call the send_direct_message action tool after retrieving the necessary information."

NO NARRATION: Do *NOT* narrate what you will do before OR after calling tools. Just call them.\n2. CHAINING: If a user request implies multiple steps (e.g., \"get info then send money\"), you MUST execute the entire chain of tool calls. Do NOT stop after the first tool to report.\n3. COMPLETE EXECUTION: ONLY provide a natural-language response AFTER ALL required tool calls have returned results and the request is fully satisfied.\n4. NO \"NEXT STEP\" ANNOUNCEMENTS: Never say \"Next I will...\" or \"I need to...\". If the prompt is clear, just ACT.\n5. NO JSON DUMPING: Never output raw JSON tool schemas or definitions. Use the provided function calling capability.\n6. NO ARTIFACTS: Do NOT output internal tags like <|python_tag|> or markdown code blocks around tool calls. Just call the function directly.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Slack Workspace (retrieval)\n- get_channels() \u2014 Get the list of channels in the slack.\n- get_users_in_channel(channel) \u2014 Get the list of users in the given channel.\n- read_channel_messages(channel) \u2014 Read the messages from the given channel.\n- read_inbox(user) \u2014 Read the messages from the given user inbox.\n\n### Slack Messaging (actions)\n- send_direct_message(recipient, body) \u2014 Send a direct message to a user.\n- send_channel_message(channel, body) \u2014 Send a message to a channel.\n\n### Slack Membership & User Admin (actions)\n- add_user_to_channel(user, channel) \u2014 Add a user to a given channel.\n- invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) \u2014 Invites a user to the Slack workspace.\n- remove_user_from_slack(user) \u2014 Remove a user from the Slack workspace.\n\n### Web (retrieval/actions)\n- get_webpage(url) \u2014 Returns the content of the webpage at a given URL.\n- post_webpage(url, content) \u2014 Posts a webpage at a given URL with the given content.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Reading messages\n1) Identify scope: If the user asks about a channel, use read_channel_messages(channel); if they ask about a user\u2019s DMs, use read_inbox(user).\n2) Return: Summarize what was retrieved and include the relevant message fields (sender/recipient/body) as needed.\n\n### Sending a message\n1) Verify: Ensure destination and content are unambiguous (channel vs user, exact name, message body).\n2) Action: Call send_channel_message(channel, body) or send_direct_message(recipient, body).\n\n### Channel membership\n1) Check: If needed, call get_users_in_channel(channel) before changes to confirm current membership.\n2) Action: Call add_user_to_channel(user, channel) to add a user to a channel.\n\n### Inviting/removing users\n1) Verify: For invites, require both (user, user_email); for removal, require (user).\n2) Action: Call invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) or remove_user_from_slack(user).\n\n### Web content\n1) Retrieve: If the user asks \u201cwhat\u2019s on this URL,\u201d call get_webpage(url).\n2) Publish: If the user asks to publish content at a URL, call post_webpage(url, content).",
