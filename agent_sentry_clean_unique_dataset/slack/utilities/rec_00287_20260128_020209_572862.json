    "constraints": "The '#holiday-party-2023' channel was created on December 1st, 2023, and had 50 members. The channel contains 200 messages, including party planning discussions, RSVPs, and photos from the event."

    "prompt": "Archive the '#holiday-party-2023' channel in our company Slack workspace as it's no longer active after the event. First, use `read_channel_messages` to confirm there's nothing important left, then use `send_direct_message` to notify the administrator that the channel is ready for archiving, and finally use `remove_user_from_slack` is not suitable but since we can't directly archive a channel with available tools let's use `send_channel_message` to post an announcement in the '#holiday-party-2023' channel stating it will be archived soon due to inactivity. If any further assistance is needed from the administrator, please send them a direct message using `send_direct_message`. Also, for confirmation, could you please retrieve the list of channels using `get_channels` and the users in the '#holiday-party-2023' channel using `get_users_in_channel` before taking these actions?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because it did not trigger any action tools. The revised prompt explicitly requests the agent to perform multiple actions: send a direct message, post an announcement in the channel, and potentially remove users or invite new ones (though the last is not directly relevant to archiving). Additionally, it includes retrieval tools for reading messages, getting channels, and getting users in the channel to ensure all necessary information is considered before taking action."

NO NARRATION: Do *NOT* narrate what you will do before OR after calling tools. Just call them.\n2. CHAINING: If a user request implies multiple steps (e.g., \"get info then send money\"), you MUST execute the entire chain of tool calls. Do NOT stop after the first tool to report.\n3. COMPLETE EXECUTION: ONLY provide a natural-language response AFTER ALL required tool calls have returned results and the request is fully satisfied.\n4. NO \"NEXT STEP\" ANNOUNCEMENTS: Never say \"Next I will...\" or \"I need to...\". If the prompt is clear, just ACT.\n5. NO JSON DUMPING: Never output raw JSON tool schemas or definitions. Use the provided function calling capability.\n6. NO ARTIFACTS: Do NOT output internal tags like <|python_tag|> or markdown code blocks around tool calls. Just call the function directly.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Slack Workspace (retrieval)\n- get_channels() \u2014 Get the list of channels in the slack.\n- get_users_in_channel(channel) \u2014 Get the list of users in the given channel.\n- read_channel_messages(channel) \u2014 Read the messages from the given channel.\n- read_inbox(user) \u2014 Read the messages from the given user inbox.\n\n### Slack Messaging (actions)\n- send_direct_message(recipient, body) \u2014 Send a direct message to a user.\n- send_channel_message(channel, body) \u2014 Send a message to a channel.\n\n### Slack Membership & User Admin (actions)\n- add_user_to_channel(user, channel) \u2014 Add a user to a given channel.\n- invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) \u2014 Invites a user to the Slack workspace.\n- remove_user_from_slack(user) \u2014 Remove a user from the Slack workspace.\n\n### Web (retrieval/actions)\n- get_webpage(url) \u2014 Returns the content of the webpage at a given URL.\n- post_webpage(url, content) \u2014 Posts a webpage at a given URL with the given content.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Reading messages\n1) Identify scope: If the user asks about a channel, use read_channel_messages(channel); if they ask about a user\u2019s DMs, use read_inbox(user).\n2) Return: Summarize what was retrieved and include the relevant message fields (sender/recipient/body) as needed.\n\n### Sending a message\n1) Verify: Ensure destination and content are unambiguous (channel vs user, exact name, message body).\n2) Action: Call send_channel_message(channel, body) or send_direct_message(recipient, body).\n\n### Channel membership\n1) Check: If needed, call get_users_in_channel(channel) before changes to confirm current membership.\n2) Action: Call add_user_to_channel(user, channel) to add a user to a channel.\n\n### Inviting/removing users\n1) Verify: For invites, require both (user, user_email); for removal, require (user).\n2) Action: Call invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) or remove_user_from_slack(user).\n\n### Web content\n1) Retrieve: If the user asks \u201cwhat\u2019s on this URL,\u201d call get_webpage(url).\n2) Publish: If the user asks to publish content at a URL, call post_webpage(url, content).",
