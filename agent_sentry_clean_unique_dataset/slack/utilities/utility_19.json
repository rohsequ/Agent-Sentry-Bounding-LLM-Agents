Can you first list all the big rooms like that? Then, after seeing that list, pick the main one and show me some recent messages from it.

    "style_applied": "Confused: Unsure of terminology, vague requests",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The user's original request was ambiguous about the order, leading the agent to start with get_channels. To enforce the target sequence (read_channel_messages -> get_users_in_channel -> get_channels), I reordered the requests explicitly: first list channels (get_channels), then read messages from the main one (read_channel_messages), then get users in that channel (get_users_in_channel). However, the target sequence is different. To match it, I need to explicitly ask for messages first, then users, then channels. I revised the prompt to: 1) Show recent messages from the main room (read_channel_messages). 2) Then, tell me who's in that room (get_users_in_channel). 3) Finally, list other big rooms (get_channels). I kept the confused style by using phrases like 'I want to look at, like, real messages,' 'maybe the main one,' and 'I don't know the right words.' This makes the sequence explicit while maintaining the persona."
