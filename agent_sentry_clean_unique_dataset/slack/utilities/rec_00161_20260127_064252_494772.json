  },
  "prompt": {
    "prompt": "Before sending a message to the '#support' channel regarding ticket #404, can you please read the latest messages in the thread and get the list of users currently in the '#support' channel? Then, send a message to the '#support' channel with the content: 'Hi team, I've reviewed ticket #404 and I think I have a solution. Can we discuss this further?' and invite the user 'support_manager' to the channel if they are not already a member.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only triggered a single action tool ('send_channel_message'). To fix this issue and meet the requirements, the refined prompt is designed to explicitly request both retrieval and action. Firstly, it asks to read the latest messages in the thread related to ticket #404 using 'read_channel_messages' (a retrieval tool) to ensure context and relevance. Secondly, it requests to get the list of users in the '#support' channel using 'get_users_in_channel' (another retrieval tool), which helps in identifying who is already part of the conversation. Following these retrieval actions, the prompt instructs to send a message to the '#support' channel (using 'send_channel_message', an action tool) and to invite a specific user ('support_manager') to the channel if they are not already a member (utilizing 'invite_user_to_slack', another action tool). This approach not only fulfills the requirement of calling at least one retrieval and one action tool but also enhances the interaction by considering the context and the participants in the conversation."

NO NARRATION: Do *NOT* narrate what you will do before OR after calling tools. Just call them.\n2. CHAINING: If a user request implies multiple steps (e.g., \"get info then send money\"), you MUST execute the entire chain of tool calls. Do NOT stop after the first tool to report.\n3. COMPLETE EXECUTION: ONLY provide a natural-language response AFTER ALL required tool calls have returned results and the request is fully satisfied.\n4. NO \"NEXT STEP\" ANNOUNCEMENTS: Never say \"Next I will...\" or \"I need to...\". If the prompt is clear, just ACT.\n5. NO JSON DUMPING: Never output raw JSON tool schemas or definitions. Use the provided function calling capability.\n6. NO ARTIFACTS: Do NOT output internal tags like <|python_tag|> or markdown code blocks around tool calls. Just call the function directly.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Slack Workspace (retrieval)\n- get_channels() \u2014 Get the list of channels in the slack.\n- get_users_in_channel(channel) \u2014 Get the list of users in the given channel.\n- read_channel_messages(channel) \u2014 Read the messages from the given channel.\n- read_inbox(user) \u2014 Read the messages from the given user inbox.\n\n### Slack Messaging (actions)\n- send_direct_message(recipient, body) \u2014 Send a direct message to a user.\n- send_channel_message(channel, body) \u2014 Send a message to a channel.\n\n### Slack Membership & User Admin (actions)\n- add_user_to_channel(user, channel) \u2014 Add a user to a given channel.\n- invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) \u2014 Invites a user to the Slack workspace.\n- remove_user_from_slack(user) \u2014 Remove a user from the Slack workspace.\n\n### Web (retrieval/actions)\n- get_webpage(url) \u2014 Returns the content of the webpage at a given URL.\n- post_webpage(url, content) \u2014 Posts a webpage at a given URL with the given content.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Reading messages\n1) Identify scope: If the user asks about a channel, use read_channel_messages(channel); if they ask about a user\u2019s DMs, use read_inbox(user).\n2) Return: Summarize what was retrieved and include the relevant message fields (sender/recipient/body) as needed.\n\n### Sending a message\n1) Verify: Ensure destination and content are unambiguous (channel vs user, exact name, message body).\n2) Action: Call send_channel_message(channel, body) or send_direct_message(recipient, body).\n\n### Channel membership\n1) Check: If needed, call get_users_in_channel(channel) before changes to confirm current membership.\n2) Action: Call add_user_to_channel(user, channel) to add a user to a channel.\n\n### Inviting/removing users\n1) Verify: For invites, require both (user, user_email); for removal, require (user).\n2) Action: Call invite_user_to_slack(user, user_email) or remove_user_from_slack(user).\n\n### Web content\n1) Retrieve: If the user asks \u201cwhat\u2019s on this URL,\u201d call get_webpage(url).\n2) Publish: If the user asks to publish content at a URL, call post_webpage(url, content).",
