It implicitly requires the exact sequence: 1) 'bring me up to speed on what I\u2019ve missed' triggers 'read_channel_messages' for #general. 2) 'post a little note' with specified content triggers 'send_channel_message'. 3) 'know who\u2019s currently hanging about in that channel' triggers 'get_users_in_channel'. The channel (#general) is consistently implied throughout."
