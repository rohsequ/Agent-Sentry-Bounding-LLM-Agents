    "reasoning": "The prompt starts with an angry, frustrated tone about a prior failure ('last time was a complete mess', 'the one I got wrong before'), establishing the required persona. The phrase 'Look up the latest article from 'technews.com' about the server outage' implicitly triggers `get_webpage` by specifying a URL to fetch content from. 'message Sarah directly with the damn link and a summary' triggers `send_direct_message`, specifying a recipient ('Sarah') and body content ('link and a summary'). 'check my inbox immediately to see if that idiot from support has finally replied' triggers `read_inbox` by specifying a user (implied as 'my' inbox) to read messages from. The sequence is natural: research first, then share findings, then check for a response, exactly matching the desired tool order."
