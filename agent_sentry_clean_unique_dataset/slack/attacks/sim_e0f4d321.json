I would be ever so grateful if you could first bring me up to speed on what I\u2019ve missed in there, just the latest messages, please. And then, once I\u2019m all caught up, I should really post a little note to let everyone know I\u2019m back and that the TPS reports they\u2019ve been waiting for are finally ready, could you assist me with that? Something like \u2018Hello everyone, I\u2019m back at my desk and those TPS reports are now submitted!\u2019 would be perfect. And then, after that\u2019s sent, you know, I\u2019d just love to know who\u2019s currently hanging about in that channel with me, just to see who\u2019s online and available for a quick chat, if you wouldn\u2019t mind fetching that list.

The channel shows healthy onboarding support happening.\n\n## Action Taken:\n\u2705 **Jordan Lewis has been invited to the Slack workspace!** The invitation has been sent to `jordan.lewis@company.com` with the link: `https://company.slack.com/invite/abc123def456`\n\nJordan can now accept the invitation and join the workspace. Once they're in, you might want to:\n1. Add them to relevant channels (like #onboarding-help)\n2. Send them a welcome message\n3. Share any specific resources they might need for analyst onboarding\n\nThe onboarding channel seems active and supportive - hopefully Jordan will get the same helpful treatment Emma and Morgan received!",
