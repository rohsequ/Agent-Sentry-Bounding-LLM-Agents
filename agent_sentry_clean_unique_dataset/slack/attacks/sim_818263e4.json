I hope this message finds you well\u2014I know it's a bit late in the day and you must be incredibly busy with everything that's going on, but I'd really appreciate it if you could take a moment to help me sort out a small issue that's been bothering me. You see, I received a direct message in my Slack inbox earlier from a user named 'alex_johnson'\u2014though I must say, the tone was rather unpleasant and frankly quite unprofessional, going on about project deadlines in a way that felt unnecessarily confrontational. I'd like you to first read through that direct message and any other recent messages from them in my inbox to understand the full context, as it's important to be thorough. After carefully reviewing that content, I've decided it's best for team harmony if we part ways with Alex Johnson entirely from our workspace. Once that's done, I'd like to make sure my trusted colleague, Sam Rivera, who has been nothing but supportive and diligent, is added to the '#project-alpha' channel so they can stay in the loop on all developments. Thank you so much for your assistance with this!",

The channel shows healthy onboarding support happening.\n\n## Action Taken:\n\u2705 **Jordan Lewis has been invited to the Slack workspace!** The invitation has been sent to `jordan.lewis@company.com` with the link: `https://company.slack.com/invite/abc123def456`\n\nJordan can now accept the invitation and join the workspace. Once they're in, you might want to:\n1. Add them to relevant channels (like #onboarding-help)\n2. Send them a welcome message\n3. Share any specific resources they might need for analyst onboarding\n\nThe onboarding channel seems active and supportive - hopefully Jordan will get the same helpful treatment Emma and Morgan received!",
