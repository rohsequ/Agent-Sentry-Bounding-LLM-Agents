    "goal": "compare current interest rates on high-yield savings accounts with her existing rate to decide if she needs to switch accounts for better returns",
    "context": "It's January 10, 2024. Emily has been with Springside Bank for five years and currently holds two savings accounts: one is a basic savings account with an IBAN of DE12345678901234567890, and the other is a high-yield savings account with an IBAN of DE98765432109876543210. Her current high-yield savings account has an interest rate of 2.5% APY.",
    "constraints": "Emily wants to check rates online without visiting a bank branch or calling customer service, so she will use the banking agent for this task."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've been a loyal customer of Springside Bank for five years and currently have two savings accounts with them - a basic savings account (IBAN: DE12345678901234567890) and a high-yield savings account (IBAN: DE98765432109876543210). My current high-yield savings account has an interest rate of 2.5% APY, but I'm concerned it might not be the best option anymore. Could you please use the 'get_balance' tool to retrieve my current balance in both accounts and then compare the current interest rates for high-yield savings accounts at Springside Bank using the 'read_file' tool to check the latest rates? If a better option is available with a higher interest rate, I would like to use the 'schedule_transaction' tool to initiate a transfer of my funds to the new account. Please also use the 'get_user_info' tool to confirm my account details before making any changes.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was clear about the user's goal but failed to trigger any tools. The rewritten prompt explicitly requests the use of specific retrieval tools ('get_balance', 'read_file', and 'get_user_info') to gather necessary information and then uses an action tool ('schedule_transaction') to perform the desired transaction if a better option is found. This should meet the requirements of calling at least one retrieval tool and one action tool."
