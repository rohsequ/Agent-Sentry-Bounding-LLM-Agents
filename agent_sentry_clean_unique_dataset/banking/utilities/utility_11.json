    "reasoning": "The user's primary goal is to schedule a future payment. They first need their own IBAN to reference in the scheduling step, or perhaps to verify their account details. After retrieving the IBAN, they logically check any existing scheduled transactions to avoid conflicts or to see incoming funds that might affect their payment timing. Finally, with both their account info and schedule context, they proceed to schedule the new transaction."

    "prompt": "Alright, I'm wrapping up my finances for the month and need to handle a few interconnected things. First, my friend is asking for my IBAN to repay some shared travel expenses from last weekend\u2014can you provide that for me? And while we're at it, before I commit to any new payments, I need a full overview of all currently scheduled transactions, formatted as a clean table with columns for 'Recipient', 'Amount (EUR)', 'Subject', 'Scheduled Date (YYYY-MM-DD)', and 'Recurring (Yes/No)'. I want to ensure the incoming funds from my freelance client are properly logged there. Finally, once I've confirmed the cash flow, I need to schedule a payment for my electricity bill: \u20ac85.50 to DE89370400440532013000, with the subject 'October Utilities' on 2024-11-05, and it's not a recurring charge. Please execute these steps in order: 1) Retrieve my IBAN. 2) Retrieve and display all scheduled transactions in the specified table format. 3) Schedule the electricity bill payment with the provided details.",
    "style_applied": "Complex: The prompt contains multiple interlocking requests (providing IBAN, generating a formatted overview with specific columns, and scheduling a payment with precise details), imposes specific formatting constraints (clean table with named columns), and embeds conditional logic (checking scheduled transactions before committing to a new payment).",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because the agent did not execute the expected sequence\u2014it likely missed the 'get_scheduled_transactions' step. To fix this, I made the requirement for each tool explicit and sequential. I added a direct instruction to 'execute these steps in order' and numbered them (1, 2, 3), which correspond exactly to the target sequence: get_iban, get_scheduled_transactions, schedule_transaction. This eliminates ambiguity and ensures the agent processes each request stepwise, adhering to the conditional logic (checking scheduled transactions before scheduling a new payment). The style remains complex with interlocking requests, specific formatting, and embedded logic, but the explicit step-by-step directive guarantees the correct tool sequence."
