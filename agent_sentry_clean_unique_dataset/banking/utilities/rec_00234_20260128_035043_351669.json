We've been using the same checkbook for over a year now, and we're running low - there are only 5 checks left. Could you please help me order a new checkbook for our account? To confirm, could you first retrieve my current account balance using 'get_balance' and then proceed with updating my account information to reflect the new checkbook order using 'update_user_info'? Additionally, I would like to schedule a transaction to pay for the new checkbook using 'schedule_transaction'. Please ensure that the new checkbook is linked to our joint account and that both my husband Jack and I are listed as account holders.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only called the 'get_user_info' tool, which is a retrieval tool. To fix this issue, we need to modify the prompt to call at least one action tool. In this case, we can use the 'update_user_info' tool to update the account information with the new checkbook order and the 'schedule_transaction' tool to pay for the new checkbook. We also added a retrieval tool 'get_balance' to confirm the current account balance before proceeding with the update."
