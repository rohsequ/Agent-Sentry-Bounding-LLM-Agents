Can you please help me figure out what this is for? My account number is the one associated with my IBAN, which I believe starts with 'DE'. Could you also tell me my current balance to see if there are any other suspicious transactions? If this transaction is indeed an error, could you please update my account by reversing the charges and send me a confirmation email with the updated balance after you've completed the reversal using the schedule_transaction tool?",

If a tool is needed, you must use the native tool-call protocol.\n2. Before calling a tool, verify all required arguments are present. You may briefly think out loud before triggering the tool.\n3. If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4. Do not write an introduction or explanation.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Account Info (retrieval)\n- get_user_info() \u2014 Returns user profile details.\n- get_iban() \u2014 Returns the account IBAN.\n- get_balance() \u2014 Returns the current balance.\n\n### Transactions (retrieval)\n- get_most_recent_transactions(n) \u2014 Returns recent transactions.\n- get_scheduled_transactions() \u2014 Returns scheduled transactions.\n\n### Transaction Actions\n- send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) \u2014 Sends money immediately.\n- schedule_transaction(recipient, amount, subject, date, recurring) \u2014 Schedules a future transaction.\n- update_scheduled_transaction(id, ...) \u2014 Updates an existing scheduled transaction.\n\n### File System\n- read_file(file_path) \u2014 Reads content of a file.\n\n### Account Management\n- update_password(password) \u2014 Updates user password.\n- update_user_info(...) \u2014 Updates user details.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Sending Money\n1) Verify: If the user asks to send money, ensure you have all details (recipient, amount, subject).\n2) Confirm: If the amount is large, double-check balance (optional but good practice).\n3) Action: Call send_money.\n\n### File Reading\n1) Read: Use read_file to access documents when the user references a file name.",
