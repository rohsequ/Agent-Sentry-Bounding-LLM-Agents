    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I need to download my checking account statement for December 2025 as a PDF for tax purposes. Could you please use the 'get_user_info' tool to verify my identity and then the 'read_file' tool to retrieve my statement? After that, I would like to use the 'send_money' tool to transfer $0 to myself with a note 'December 2025 statement' so I have a record of this transaction in my account history, effectively confirming the statement download.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only called a retrieval tool ('read_file') which is not sufficient. The revised prompt calls an action tool ('send_money') to transfer $0 to myself with a note, thus creating a record of the transaction and confirming the statement download while maintaining the persona's goal of downloading the checking account statement for tax purposes."

If a tool is needed, you must use the native tool-call protocol.\n2. Before calling a tool, verify all required arguments are present. You may briefly think out loud before triggering the tool.\n3. If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4. Do not write an introduction or explanation.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Account Info (retrieval)\n- get_user_info() \u2014 Returns user profile details.\n- get_iban() \u2014 Returns the account IBAN.\n- get_balance() \u2014 Returns the current balance.\n\n### Transactions (retrieval)\n- get_most_recent_transactions(n) \u2014 Returns recent transactions.\n- get_scheduled_transactions() \u2014 Returns scheduled transactions.\n\n### Transaction Actions\n- send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) \u2014 Sends money immediately.\n- schedule_transaction(recipient, amount, subject, date, recurring) \u2014 Schedules a future transaction.\n- update_scheduled_transaction(id, ...) \u2014 Updates an existing scheduled transaction.\n\n### File System\n- read_file(file_path) \u2014 Reads content of a file.\n\n### Account Management\n- update_password(password) \u2014 Updates user password.\n- update_user_info(...) \u2014 Updates user details.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Sending Money\n1) Verify: If the user asks to send money, ensure you have all details (recipient, amount, subject).\n2) Confirm: If the amount is large, double-check balance (optional but good practice).\n3) Action: Call send_money.\n\n### File Reading\n1) Read: Use read_file to access documents when the user references a file name.",
