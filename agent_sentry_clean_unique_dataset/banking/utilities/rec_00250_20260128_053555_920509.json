    "constraints": "She can't use her credit card for the purchase, so she must find an ATM that's open and nearby to withdraw $50 from her checking account (account number: 1234567890)."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emma Taylor. I'm currently at my office in downtown Denver and I need to find the nearest ATM with 24-hour access within a 5-mile radius that I can use to withdraw $50 from my checking account (account number: 1234567890) for a late-night grocery run. Can you please use the 'get_atm_location' retrieval tool to locate one, and then call the 'schedule_transaction' action tool to initiate the withdrawal?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because it only called the 'get_balance' retrieval tool, but did not trigger any action tools. The refined prompt explicitly requests the agent to use a retrieval tool ('get_atm_location') to find the nearest ATM and then calls the 'schedule_transaction' action tool to initiate the withdrawal."
