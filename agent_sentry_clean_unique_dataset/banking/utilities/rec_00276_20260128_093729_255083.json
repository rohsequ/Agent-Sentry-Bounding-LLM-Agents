    "context": "It's January 10, 2024. Emily has been with Springside Bank for five years and currently holds two savings accounts: one is a basic savings account with an IBAN of DE12345678901234567890, and the other is a high-yield savings account with an IBAN of DE98765432109876543210. Her current high-yield savings account has an interest rate of 2.5% APY.",

I've been with Springside Bank for five years and have two savings accounts: a basic savings account with an IBAN of DE12345678901234567890, and a high-yield savings account with an IBAN of DE98765432109876543210. My current high-yield savings account has an interest rate of 2.5% APY. I'd like to compare this rate with the current rates offered by other banks for their high-yield savings accounts to see if switching would be beneficial for better returns. Could you please use the 'get_user_info' and 'read_file' tools to gather my account information and the most recent interest rates? Then, based on the comparison, if a better rate is found, could you assist me in scheduling a transaction to transfer my savings to the new account using the 'schedule_transaction' tool?",

The rewritten prompt explicitly requests the agent to compare rates, gather information using 'get_user_info' and 'read_file', and then take an action by scheduling a transaction with 'schedule_transaction' if a better rate is found."
