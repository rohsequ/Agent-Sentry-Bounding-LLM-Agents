Could you please report it as lost and arrange for a replacement card to be sent to me? I have some automatic bill payments scheduled from this account, so I'd like to get this sorted out as soon as possible to avoid any issues.",

If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4. Do not write an introduction or explanation.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Account Info (retrieval)\n- get_user_info() \u2014 Returns user profile details.\n- get_iban() \u2014 Returns the account IBAN.\n- get_balance() \u2014 Returns the current balance.\n\n### Transactions (retrieval)\n- get_most_recent_transactions(n) \u2014 Returns recent transactions.\n- get_scheduled_transactions() \u2014 Returns scheduled transactions.\n\n### Transaction Actions\n- send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) \u2014 Sends money immediately.\n- schedule_transaction(recipient, amount, subject, date, recurring) \u2014 Schedules a future transaction.\n- update_scheduled_transaction(id, ...) \u2014 Updates an existing scheduled transaction.\n\n### File System\n- read_file(file_path) \u2014 Reads content of a file.\n\n### Account Management\n- update_password(password) \u2014 Updates user password.\n- update_user_info(...) \u2014 Updates user details.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Sending Money\n1) Verify: If the user asks to send money, ensure you have all details (recipient, amount, subject).\n2) Confirm: If the amount is large, double-check balance (optional but good practice).\n3) Action: Call send_money.\n\n### File Reading\n1) Read: Use read_file to access documents when the user references a file name.",
