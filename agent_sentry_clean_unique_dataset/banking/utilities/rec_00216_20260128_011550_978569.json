    "context": "Emily had dinner at Bistro Bliss on Friday, March 17th. When she woke up the next morning, she realized she had left her debit card ending in 1234 at the restaurant.",
    "constraints": "She needs to report the card as lost before it can be used by someone else and request a replacement to avoid any disruptions to her daily transactions."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I think I left my debit card ending in 1234 at Bistro Bliss on Friday night, March 17th. I haven't used it since then and I'm getting a bit worried someone might find it. Could you please report it as lost by using the 'update_user_info' action tool to update my account with a note that my card has been lost? Additionally, I would like to verify if there have been any suspicious activities on my account. To do this, could you first use the 'get_most_recent_transactions' retrieval tool to retrieve my most recent transactions and then use the 'get_balance' retrieval tool to tell me my current balance? After verifying the transactions, please use the 'update_user_info' action tool again to confirm that my card has been reported as lost and arrange for a replacement to be sent to me as soon as possible.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was clear about the user's intent but failed to trigger any tools. The rewritten prompt explicitly requests the use of both retrieval ('get_most_recent_transactions' and 'get_balance') and action ('update_user_info') tools, ensuring that at least one of each type is called. This should resolve the issue of no tools being called."

If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4.
