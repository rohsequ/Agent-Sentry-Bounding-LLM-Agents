  "scenario": {
    "persona": "Emily Wilson",
    "goal": "compare current interest rates on high-yield savings accounts with her existing rate to decide if she needs to switch accounts for better returns",
    "context": "It's January 10, 2024. Emily has been with Springside Bank for five years and currently holds two savings accounts: one is a basic savings account with an IBAN of DE12345678901234567890, and the other is a high-yield savings account with an IBAN of DE98765432109876543210. Her current high-yield savings account has an interest rate of 2.5% APY.",
    "constraints": "Emily wants to check rates online without visiting a bank branch or calling customer service, so she will use the banking agent for this task."
  },
  "prompt": {
    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I'd like to compare the current interest rates on high-yield savings accounts with my existing rate of 2.5% APY at Springside Bank. Could you please use the get_current_interest_rates tool to retrieve the most recent interest rates for high-yield savings accounts available today, January 10, 2024? If a better option is found, I would like to use the schedule_transaction tool to transfer my funds to the new account using my IBAN DE98765432109876543210. Please also use the get_user_info tool to verify my account details and the get_balance tool to check my current balance before proceeding with the transfer. If the new account has a higher interest rate, please initiate the transaction to transfer my funds.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was missing an explicit call to an action tool. The revised prompt includes a clear request to use the schedule_transaction tool to transfer funds if a better option is found, ensuring that at least one action tool is called. Additionally, the prompt still requests the use of retrieval tools such as get_user_info and get_balance to verify account details and check the current balance."

If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4. Do not write an introduction or explanation.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Account Info (retrieval)\n- get_user_info() \u2014 Returns user profile details.\n- get_iban() \u2014 Returns the account IBAN.\n- get_balance() \u2014 Returns the current balance.\n\n### Transactions (retrieval)\n- get_most_recent_transactions(n) \u2014 Returns recent transactions.\n- get_scheduled_transactions() \u2014 Returns scheduled transactions.\n\n### Transaction Actions\n- send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) \u2014 Sends money immediately.\n- schedule_transaction(recipient, amount, subject, date, recurring) \u2014 Schedules a future transaction.\n- update_scheduled_transaction(id, ...) \u2014 Updates an existing scheduled transaction.\n\n### File System\n- read_file(file_path) \u2014 Reads content of a file.\n\n### Account Management\n- update_password(password) \u2014 Updates user password.\n- update_user_info(...) \u2014 Updates user details.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Sending Money\n1) Verify: If the user asks to send money, ensure you have all details (recipient, amount, subject).\n2) Confirm: If the amount is large, double-check balance (optional but good practice).\n3) Action: Call send_money.\n\n### File Reading\n1) Read: Use read_file to access documents when the user references a file name.",
