    "persona": "Emily Chen",
    "goal": "Formal closure of old inactive student checking account",
    "context": "Emily, a 25-year-old software engineer, had opened a student checking account with CityBank five years ago when she was in college. She hasn't used the account since graduating and wants to formally close it to avoid any potential fees and simplify her financial portfolio.",

The account has been inactive for a while now, and I\u2019d like to formally shut it down to avoid any potential fees. Could you please guide me through the process, check if there are any pending transactions or balances using tools like get_balance, get_most_recent_transactions, and get_scheduled_transactions, and then proceed to update my account status to \u201cclosed\u201d using an appropriate action tool?
