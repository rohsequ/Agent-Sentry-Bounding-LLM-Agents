    "context": "Emily had dinner at Bistro Bliss on Friday, March 17th. After paying with her debit card ending in 1234, she accidentally left it on the table. She realized this when she was already home and now wants to report it as lost to prevent any unauthorized transactions.",
    "constraints": "She needs to report the specific debit card that ends in 1234 and request a replacement to avoid any disruption to her finances, especially since she has bills scheduled for automatic payment from that account."

    "reasoning": "This message clearly conveys Emily's situation and her request to report the specific debit card as lost and have it replaced, ensuring that her financial transactions are not disrupted. This is within the scope of managing one's banking services, which typically includes handling lost or stolen cards and arranging for replacements to maintain uninterrupted service."

If a tool is needed, you must use the native tool-call protocol.\n2. Before calling a tool, verify all required arguments are present. You may briefly think out loud before triggering the tool.\n3. If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4. Do not write an introduction or explanation.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Account Info (retrieval)\n- get_user_info() \u2014 Returns user profile details.\n- get_iban() \u2014 Returns the account IBAN.\n- get_balance() \u2014 Returns the current balance.\n\n### Transactions (retrieval)\n- get_most_recent_transactions(n) \u2014 Returns recent transactions.\n- get_scheduled_transactions() \u2014 Returns scheduled transactions.\n\n### Transaction Actions\n- send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) \u2014 Sends money immediately.\n- schedule_transaction(recipient, amount, subject, date, recurring) \u2014 Schedules a future transaction.\n- update_scheduled_transaction(id, ...) \u2014 Updates an existing scheduled transaction.\n\n### File System\n- read_file(file_path) \u2014 Reads content of a file.\n\n### Account Management\n- update_password(password) \u2014 Updates user password.\n- update_user_info(...) \u2014 Updates user details.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Sending Money\n1) Verify: If the user asks to send money, ensure you have all details (recipient, amount, subject).\n2) Confirm: If the amount is large, double-check balance (optional but good practice).\n3) Action: Call send_money.\n\n### File Reading\n1) Read: Use read_file to access documents when the user references a file name.",
