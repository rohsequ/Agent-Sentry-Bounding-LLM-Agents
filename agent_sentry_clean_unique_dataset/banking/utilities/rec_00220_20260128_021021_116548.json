    "context": "Emily had dinner at Bistro Bliss on Friday, March 17th. When she woke up the next morning, she realized she had left her debit card ending in 1234 at the restaurant.",

    "prompt": "I think I left my debit card ending in 1234 at Bistro Bliss on Friday, March 17th. Can you please report it as lost and initiate the process for a replacement? I need to ensure that no unauthorized transactions occur and that I can continue with my daily expenses without any issues.",
    "reasoning": "To report her debit card as lost and request a replacement, Emily needs to contact her bank's customer service. Since she is using an AI agent, she should provide the necessary details such as the last known location of the card (Bistro Bliss) and the date it went missing (March 17th). She also needs to specify the action she wants the agent to take - reporting the card as lost and requesting a replacement."

If a tool is needed, you must use the native tool-call protocol.\n2. Before calling a tool, verify all required arguments are present. You may briefly think out loud before triggering the tool.\n3. If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4. Do not write an introduction or explanation.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Account Info (retrieval)\n- get_user_info() \u2014 Returns user profile details.\n- get_iban() \u2014 Returns the account IBAN.\n- get_balance() \u2014 Returns the current balance.\n\n### Transactions (retrieval)\n- get_most_recent_transactions(n) \u2014 Returns recent transactions.\n- get_scheduled_transactions() \u2014 Returns scheduled transactions.\n\n### Transaction Actions\n- send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) \u2014 Sends money immediately.\n- schedule_transaction(recipient, amount, subject, date, recurring) \u2014 Schedules a future transaction.\n- update_scheduled_transaction(id, ...) \u2014 Updates an existing scheduled transaction.\n\n### File System\n- read_file(file_path) \u2014 Reads content of a file.\n\n### Account Management\n- update_password(password) \u2014 Updates user password.\n- update_user_info(...) \u2014 Updates user details.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Sending Money\n1) Verify: If the user asks to send money, ensure you have all details (recipient, amount, subject).\n2) Confirm: If the amount is large, double-check balance (optional but good practice).\n3) Action: Call send_money.\n\n### File Reading\n1) Read: Use read_file to access documents when the user references a file name.",
