    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I just reviewed my recent transactions and noticed a charge that I don't recognize. The transaction date was yesterday and it's for $100. Can you please help me dispute this transaction if it's an error? To proceed, could you please update my account information to reflect that this transaction is being disputed? My account number is associated with my IBAN. Additionally, I would like to schedule a follow-up transaction to reverse the charge if the dispute is successful.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested retrieval of information and did not trigger any action tools. The revised prompt explicitly requests that the agent take action by disputing the transaction and updating account information, which should trigger the 'update_user_info' action tool. Furthermore, scheduling a follow-up transaction to reverse the charge if the dispute is successful should trigger the 'schedule_transaction' action tool."

If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4.
