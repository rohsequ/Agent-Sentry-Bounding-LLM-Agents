    "context": "Emily, a 25-year-old software engineer, had opened a student checking account with CityBank five years ago when she was in college. She hasn't used the account since graduating and wants to formally close it to avoid any potential fees and simplify her financial portfolio.",

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Chen, and I'd like to close my old student checking account that I've had with CityBank since college. The account has been inactive for a while now, with no pending transactions. Could you please guide me through the process of formally closing this account? First, could you retrieve my current account balance using 'get_balance' and my account information using 'get_user_info'? If everything looks correct, I'd like to proceed with updating my account status to 'closed' using 'update_user_info'.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt did not trigger any retrieval tools. By explicitly requesting the agent to call 'get_balance' and 'get_user_info', we ensure that at least one retrieval tool is called. Additionally, the prompt still requests an action ('update_user_info') which meets the requirement of calling at least one action tool."
