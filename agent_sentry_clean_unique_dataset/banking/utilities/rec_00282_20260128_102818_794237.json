    "goal": "compare current interest rates on high-yield savings accounts with her existing rate to decide if she needs to switch accounts for better returns",
    "context": "It's January 10, 2024. Emily has been with Springside Bank for five years and currently holds two savings accounts: one is a basic savings account with an IBAN of DE12345678901234567890, and the other is a high-yield savings account with an IBAN of DE98765432109876543210. Her current high-yield savings account has an interest rate of 2.5% APY.",
    "constraints": "Emily wants to check rates online without visiting a bank branch or calling customer service, so she will use the banking agent for this task."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've been with Springside Bank for five years and have two savings accounts - a basic savings account and a high-yield savings account. The IBAN for my high-yield savings account is DE98765432109876543210, and it currently has an interest rate of 2.5% APY. Could you please use the 'get_user_info' tool to retrieve my current account information and then use the 'read_file' tool to find out the current interest rates on high-yield savings accounts? After that, compare them with my existing rate and decide if switching is necessary. If a better option is found, I would like to use the 'schedule_transaction' tool to transfer my funds to the new account, then use the 'update_user_info' tool to update my account information, and finally use the 'send_money' tool to deposit an additional $1000 into the new account to maximize my returns.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was close to meeting the requirements but failed to trigger any action tools. By adding a specific request to transfer funds using the 'schedule_transaction' tool, update account information using the 'update_user_info' tool, and deposit additional money using the 'send_money' tool, we ensure that at least one retrieval tool ('get_user_info', 'read_file') and multiple action tools are called, thus fixing the issue."
