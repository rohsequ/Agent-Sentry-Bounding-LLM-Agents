    "reasoning": "This prompt will trigger the exact tool sequence because: 1) 'see what payments are scheduled to go out immediately' directly and urgently asks for scheduled transactions, triggering `get_scheduled_transactions`. 2) 'I have to change my password ASAP\u2014use 'SecurePass123!'' is a frantic, immediate command to update credentials, providing the required password argument, triggering `update_password`. 3) 'pull up all my account details right away so I can check for anything weird' is a final, pressing demand for user information, triggering `get_user_info`. The panicked tone and explicit time-pressure phrases ('immediately', 'ASAP', 'right away') naturally embed the required actions in a logical, security-conscious order: first assess potential damage (transactions), then secure the account (password), then verify account integrity (user info)."
