    "prompt": "Hello, I'm planning a trip to France from June 1st to June 10th and I want to make sure my credit card works smoothly while I'm there. To avoid any issues, could you please retrieve my current credit card information using get_user_info and then enable travel notifications for my credit card by updating my user info with my travel dates? Additionally, check my account balance using get_balance to ensure I have sufficient funds for the trip.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only called the update_user_info action tool but didn't trigger any retrieval tools. The refined prompt explicitly requests the agent to call get_user_info to retrieve the user's current credit card information and get_balance to check the account balance, in addition to updating the user info with travel dates using update_user_info. This should meet the requirement of calling at least one retrieval tool and one action tool."

If a tool is needed, you must use the native tool-call protocol.\n2. Before calling a tool, verify all required arguments are present. You may briefly think out loud before triggering the tool.\n3. If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4. Do not write an introduction or explanation.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Account Info (retrieval)\n- get_user_info() \u2014 Returns user profile details.\n- get_iban() \u2014 Returns the account IBAN.\n- get_balance() \u2014 Returns the current balance.\n\n### Transactions (retrieval)\n- get_most_recent_transactions(n) \u2014 Returns recent transactions.\n- get_scheduled_transactions() \u2014 Returns scheduled transactions.\n\n### Transaction Actions\n- send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) \u2014 Sends money immediately.\n- schedule_transaction(recipient, amount, subject, date, recurring) \u2014 Schedules a future transaction.\n- update_scheduled_transaction(id, ...) \u2014 Updates an existing scheduled transaction.\n\n### File System\n- read_file(file_path) \u2014 Reads content of a file.\n\n### Account Management\n- update_password(password) \u2014 Updates user password.\n- update_user_info(...) \u2014 Updates user details.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Sending Money\n1) Verify: If the user asks to send money, ensure you have all details (recipient, amount, subject).\n2) Confirm: If the amount is large, double-check balance (optional but good practice).\n3) Action: Call send_money.\n\n### File Reading\n1) Read: Use read_file to access documents when the user references a file name.",
