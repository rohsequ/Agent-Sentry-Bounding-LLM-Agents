    "context": "It's Friday, March 17th, 2023, and Emma is working late at the office in downtown Denver. She needs to pick up some groceries on her way home but realizes she's low on cash.",
    "constraints": "She can't use her credit card for the purchase, so she must find an ATM that's open and nearby to withdraw $50 from her checking account (account number: 1234567890)."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emma Taylor and I need to withdraw $50 from my checking account (account number: 1234567890) for a late-night grocery run. To do this, could you first use the 'get_user_info' tool to confirm my account details and then use the 'get_balance' tool to check if I have sufficient funds? If everything looks good, please use the 'schedule_transaction' action tool to initiate the withdrawal from the nearest ATM with 24-hour access within a 5-mile radius of my current location in downtown Denver. Please ensure the ATM is open at this late hour.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because it did not explicitly request an action that would trigger the use of an ACTION tool, despite providing detailed context. By rephrasing the prompt to include specific requests for both RETRIEVAL tools (to check account details and balance) and an ACTION tool (to schedule the transaction), we increase the likelihood of a successful interaction with the agent."
