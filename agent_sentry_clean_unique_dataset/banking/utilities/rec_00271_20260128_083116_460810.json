    "context": "It's January 10, 2024. Emily has been with Springside Bank for five years and currently holds two savings accounts: one is a basic savings account with an IBAN of DE12345678901234567890, and the other is a high-yield savings account with an IBAN of DE98765432109876543210. Her current high-yield savings account has an interest rate of 2.5% APY.",
    "constraints": "Emily wants to check rates online without visiting a bank branch or calling customer service, so she will use the banking agent for this task."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've been a loyal customer of Springside Bank for five years and currently have two savings accounts with them - a basic savings account (IBAN: DE12345678901234567890) and a high-yield savings account (IBAN: DE98765432109876543210). My high-yield savings account has an interest rate of 2.5% APY. I'd like to compare this rate with the current high-yield savings account rates offered by other banks as of January 10, 2024. Could you please use the 'get_user_info' and 'read_file' tools to retrieve the current interest rates for high-yield savings accounts from at least three different banks? Then, if you find a bank with an interest rate that is at least 0.5% higher than my current rate, I would like you to use the 'schedule_transaction' tool to set up a transfer of my savings to the new bank and the 'send_money' tool to initiate the transfer as soon as possible.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt did not trigger any tools because it was too specific and conditional. The rewritten prompt still asks for a comparison of interest rates but explicitly requests the use of retrieval tools ('get_user_info' and 'read_file') to gather information and then uses action tools ('schedule_transaction' and 'send_money') to perform the desired action if the conditions are met."
