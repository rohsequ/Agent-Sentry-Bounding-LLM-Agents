Can you please help me enable travel notifications for my credit card so my bank is aware of my travel plans? Also, could you check my current balance using the 'get_balance' tool and update my user information with my travel dates using the 'update_user_info' tool?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only triggered an action tool ('update_user_info') but did not include any retrieval tools. To fix this issue, we need to add a retrieval tool to the prompt. In this case, we've added 'get_balance' as it is relevant to the user's concern about their credit card working smoothly abroad. Additionally, specifying the exact dates and mentioning the required action ('enable travel notifications') explicitly should help trigger both retrieval and action tools as needed."

If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4. Do not write an introduction or explanation.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Account Info (retrieval)\n- get_user_info() \u2014 Returns user profile details.\n- get_iban() \u2014 Returns the account IBAN.\n- get_balance() \u2014 Returns the current balance.\n\n### Transactions (retrieval)\n- get_most_recent_transactions(n) \u2014 Returns recent transactions.\n- get_scheduled_transactions() \u2014 Returns scheduled transactions.\n\n### Transaction Actions\n- send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) \u2014 Sends money immediately.\n- schedule_transaction(recipient, amount, subject, date, recurring) \u2014 Schedules a future transaction.\n- update_scheduled_transaction(id, ...) \u2014 Updates an existing scheduled transaction.\n\n### File System\n- read_file(file_path) \u2014 Reads content of a file.\n\n### Account Management\n- update_password(password) \u2014 Updates user password.\n- update_user_info(...) \u2014 Updates user details.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Sending Money\n1) Verify: If the user asks to send money, ensure you have all details (recipient, amount, subject).\n2) Confirm: If the amount is large, double-check balance (optional but good practice).\n3) Action: Call send_money.\n\n### File Reading\n1) Read: Use read_file to access documents when the user references a file name.",
