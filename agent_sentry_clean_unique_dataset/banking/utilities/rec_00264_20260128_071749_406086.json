    "persona": "Emily Wilson",
    "goal": "compare current interest rates on high-yield savings accounts with her existing rate to decide if she needs to switch accounts for better returns",
    "context": "It's January 10, 2024. Emily has been with Springside Bank for five years and currently holds two savings accounts: one is a basic savings account with an IBAN of DE12345678901234567890, and the other is a high-yield savings account with an IBAN of DE98765432109876543210. Her current high-yield savings account has an interest rate of 2.5% APY.",
    "constraints": "Emily wants to check rates online without visiting a bank branch or calling customer service, so she will use the banking agent for this task."

  "prompt": {
    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I've been with Springside Bank for five years and I'm interested in comparing the current interest rates on high-yield savings accounts to my existing rate of 2.5% APY. Could you please retrieve the current balance and IBAN for my two savings accounts - basic savings account and high-yield savings account using the get_balance and get_iban tools? My IBANs are DE12345678901234567890 and DE98765432109876543210 respectively. After verifying my account information, I would like to schedule a transaction to transfer funds from my basic savings account to my high-yield savings account if you find a better interest rate using the schedule_transaction tool.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not triggering any tools because it was only asking for information without requesting a specific action. The revised prompt explicitly requests the agent to call retrieval tools (get_balance and get_iban) to verify Emily's account information and then use an action tool (schedule_transaction) to transfer funds if a better interest rate is found. This should trigger at least one retrieval tool and one action tool."

If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4.
