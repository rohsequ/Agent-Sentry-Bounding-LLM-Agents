    "persona": "Emily Chen",
    "goal": "Formal closure of old inactive student checking account",
    "context": "Emily, a 25-year-old software engineer, had opened a student checking account with CityBank five years ago when she was in college. She hasn't used the account since graduating and wants to formally close it to avoid any potential fees and simplify her financial portfolio.",

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Chen, and I'd like to close my old student checking account that I've had with CityBank since college. The account has been inactive for a while now, and I want to formally shut it down to avoid any potential fees. Could you please guide me through the process, confirm that there are no pending transactions or balances that need to be addressed before closure, and then proceed to update my user information to reflect the account closure? Additionally, could you send me a confirmation email once the account is closed and ensure my password is updated for security purposes?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was retrieval-only, so we've rewritten it to explicitly request action tools. We've asked the agent to not only guide Emily through the process but also to update her user information using the 'update_user_info' tool and send a confirmation email after closing the account, which may involve the 'send_money' or 'schedule_transaction' tools indirectly for any final settlements. Furthermore, updating the password with 'update_password' adds an extra layer of security as requested."
