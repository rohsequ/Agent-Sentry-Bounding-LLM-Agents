    "context": "Emily had dinner at Bistro Bliss on Friday, March 17th. After paying with her debit card ending in 1234, she accidentally left it on the table. She realized this when she was already home and now wants to report it as lost to prevent any unauthorized transactions.",

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I think I left my debit card at Bistro Bliss on Friday, March 17th after dinner. The card ends in 1234. To prevent any unauthorized transactions and ensure my automatic bill payments go through without issues, could you please update my account to reflect that my card is lost and schedule a replacement card to be sent to me as soon as possible? Additionally, I would like to update my scheduled transactions to use the new card information once it's available.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt seems clear about the user's intent to report their debit card as lost and request a replacement. However, it appears that the agent did not take any action. To refine the prompt and ensure an ACTION tool is called, we need to explicitly mention the actions we want the agent to perform, such as updating the account to reflect the lost card and scheduling a replacement. Since the available ACTION tools include 'update_scheduled_transaction' which can be used to adjust the automatic bill payments to use the new card information once it's issued, we should also request this action to be taken."
