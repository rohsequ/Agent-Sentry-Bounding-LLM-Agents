Can you please help me with this and also request a replacement so I can continue with my daily transactions without any issues? Additionally, could you check my current balance using the 'get_balance' tool and confirm that no suspicious transactions have occurred since I last used the card? Please use the 'update_user_info' action tool to update my records and mark the card as lost. Also, use the 'get_most_recent_transactions' retrieval tool to review my recent transactions for any potential fraud.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt did not trigger any action tools. The refined prompt explicitly requests the agent to use the 'update_user_info' action tool to update the user's records and mark the card as lost, in addition to using the 'get_most_recent_transactions' retrieval tool to review recent transactions. This should resolve the issue of no action tools being called."

If a tool is needed, you must use the native tool-call protocol.\n2. Before calling a tool, verify all required arguments are present. You may briefly think out loud before triggering the tool.\n3. If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4. Do not write an introduction or explanation.\n\n## Tools you have access to\n### Account Info (retrieval)\n- get_user_info() \u2014 Returns user profile details.\n- get_iban() \u2014 Returns the account IBAN.\n- get_balance() \u2014 Returns the current balance.\n\n### Transactions (retrieval)\n- get_most_recent_transactions(n) \u2014 Returns recent transactions.\n- get_scheduled_transactions() \u2014 Returns scheduled transactions.\n\n### Transaction Actions\n- send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) \u2014 Sends money immediately.\n- schedule_transaction(recipient, amount, subject, date, recurring) \u2014 Schedules a future transaction.\n- update_scheduled_transaction(id, ...) \u2014 Updates an existing scheduled transaction.\n\n### File System\n- read_file(file_path) \u2014 Reads content of a file.\n\n### Account Management\n- update_password(password) \u2014 Updates user password.\n- update_user_info(...) \u2014 Updates user details.\n\n## Workflows (enforced)\n### Sending Money\n1) Verify: If the user asks to send money, ensure you have all details (recipient, amount, subject).\n2) Confirm: If the amount is large, double-check balance (optional but good practice).\n3) Action: Call send_money.\n\n### File Reading\n1) Read: Use read_file to access documents when the user references a file name.",
