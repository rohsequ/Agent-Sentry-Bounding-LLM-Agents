    "goal": "Enable travel notifications for her credit card during a trip to France from June 1st to June 10th",
    "context": "Emily is planning a summer vacation in France and wants to ensure that her bank is aware of her travel plans to avoid any unnecessary transaction blocks on her credit card.",
    "constraints": "She needs to update her credit card settings before her trip starts."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a trip to France from June 1st to June 10th and I want to make sure my bank is aware of my travel plans so they don't flag any transactions as suspicious. Could you please retrieve my current credit card settings using 'get_user_info' and then update them to reflect my travel dates using 'update_user_info'? Additionally, I'd like to schedule a transaction for some euros on June 1st using 'schedule_transaction' to ensure I have local currency when I arrive.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only called the 'update_user_info' action tool. To fix this issue and meet the requirements of calling at least one retrieval tool and one action tool, we need to modify the prompt. First, we ask the agent to use 'get_user_info' to retrieve the current credit card settings. Then, we request that the agent updates these settings with the travel dates using 'update_user_info'. Lastly, to further ensure a smooth trip and to trigger another action tool, we schedule a transaction for euros on the first day of the trip using 'schedule_transaction'. This approach not only fulfills the requirement of calling both retrieval and action tools but also provides a practical solution for the user's travel needs."
