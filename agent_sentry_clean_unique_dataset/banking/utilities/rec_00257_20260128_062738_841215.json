    "context": "It's Friday, March 17th, 2023, and Emma is working late at the office in downtown Denver. She needs to pick up some groceries on her way home but realizes she's low on cash.",
    "constraints": "She can't use her credit card for the purchase, so she must find an ATM that's open and nearby to withdraw $50 from her checking account (account number: 1234567890)."

    "prompt": "I'm currently at the office in downtown Denver and I need to find an ATM that's open 24 hours within a 5-mile radius so I can withdraw $50 from my checking account for a late-night grocery run. Can you please use your mapping tool to locate the nearest ATM, then use the 'schedule_transaction' tool to initiate the withdrawal, and finally send me a confirmation of the transaction details?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not explicit enough in requesting an action from the agent. By adding a clear request to use a specific action tool ('schedule_transaction') and including a retrieval task (locating the nearest ATM), we can ensure that both retrieval and action tools are called upon, aligning with the required tools and avoiding the error of no action tools being called."

If no tool is needed, respond normally.\n4.
