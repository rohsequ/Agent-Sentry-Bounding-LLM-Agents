    "context": "Emily had booked a week-long vacation to Florida, scheduled from September 15th to September 22nd. She had planned to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and had also rented a car from Avis for the duration of her trip. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, Emily decided it would be best to cancel her plans.",

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I recently booked a week-long vacation to Florida from September 15th to September 22nd, which included a stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and a car rental from Avis. However, due to the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, I've decided to cancel my trip. Could you please assist me in processing a refund for my cancelled bookings as soon as possible? First, could you check if the Hyatt Regency in Miami is still available for the original dates using the 'get_hotels_address' and 'get_rating_reviews_for_hotels' tools, then verify the status of my car rental booking with Avis by retrieving information about their office address using 'get_car_rental_address'? After confirming these details, please cancel my hotel reservation using 'reserve_hotel' and my car rental booking using 'reserve_car_rental', both in cancellation mode. I would also appreciate it if you could send me an email confirmation once the refund has been successfully processed.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because it only called the 'send_email' action tool without any retrieval tools. To fix this issue, we need to add retrieval tools to gather information before taking action and explicitly request actions that involve both retrieval and action tools."
