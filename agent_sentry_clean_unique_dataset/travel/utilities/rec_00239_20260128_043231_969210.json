    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson and I'm excited to explore Prague on my vacation. I have a free Saturday afternoon and I'm really interested in learning about the city's history and architecture. Could you please help me find and book a guided city walking tour for that time? First, search for highly-rated tours using 'get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants' and then reserve the best one by calling 'reserve_restaurant'. Also, make sure to create a calendar event for the tour using 'create_calendar_event'. I'd love to see some of the famous landmarks and hidden gems, and get a deeper understanding of the city's rich past.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was missing a retrieval tool call. To fix this, we added a request to search for highly-rated tours, which should trigger the 'get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants' retrieval tool. We also explicitly requested the agent to book the tour using 'reserve_restaurant', which is an action tool. Additionally, we kept the original request to create a calendar event using 'create_calendar_event'. This refined prompt should now call at least one retrieval tool and one action tool."
