    "context": "Emily is traveling to Los Angeles for a business conference and needs a reliable mode of transportation. She prefers a compact car due to ease of parking and fuel efficiency.",
    "constraints": "The rental period should be from Friday, March 19th to Monday, March 22nd. Emily's flight arrives at 9:00 AM, so she wants to pick up the car at 10:00 AM to allow time for baggage claim and checking in with the rental company. She also wants to ensure that the car rental company has good reviews and is conveniently located near the airport terminal.."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Chen and I'll be arriving at LAX Airport on Friday, March 19th at 9:00 AM. I need to rent a compact car for 3 days, from Friday to Monday, March 22nd. Could you please find a reliable car rental company near the airport terminal with good reviews using the 'get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental' tool and then reserve the car for me using the 'reserve_car_rental' tool? I'd like to pick up the car at 10:00 AM on Friday, after I've collected my baggage. Please make sure to book the car using my information and send me a confirmation email with the reservation details using the 'send_email' tool.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because it only called a retrieval tool ('get_all_car_rental_companies_in_city') but didn't trigger any action tools. To fix this, we need to explicitly request an action in the prompt. We've added requests to use 'get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental' to find a reliable company and 'reserve_car_rental' to book the car, as well as 'send_email' to send a confirmation email. This should trigger both retrieval and action tools as required."
