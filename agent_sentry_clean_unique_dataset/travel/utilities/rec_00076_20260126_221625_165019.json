    "constraints": "The rental period should be from Friday, March 19th to Monday, March 22nd. Emily's flight arrives at 9:00 AM, so she wants to pick up the car at 10:00 AM to allow time for baggage claim and checking in with the rental company.

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Chen. I need to rent a compact car at LAX Airport from Friday, March 19th to Monday, March 22nd. My flight arrives at 9:00 AM on the 19th, so I'd like to pick up the car at 10:00 AM. Could you please find me a reliable car rental company near the airport terminal with good reviews and reserve a compact car for me during my specified time frame? Also, make sure they have cars available for rent on those dates.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested information about car rental companies, but did not ask the agent to perform any actions. To fix this, the refined prompt asks the agent to not only find a reliable car rental company, but also to reserve a compact car for the specified time frame. This should trigger the 'reserve_car_rental' action tool."
