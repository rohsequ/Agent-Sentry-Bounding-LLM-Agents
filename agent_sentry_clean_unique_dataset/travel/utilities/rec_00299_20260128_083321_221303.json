    "goal": "Request a refund for her cancelled trip to Florida due to a hurricane warning.",
    "context": "Emily had booked a week-long vacation to Florida, scheduled from September 15th to September 22nd. She had planned to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and had also rented a car from Avis for the duration of her trip. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, Emily decided it would be best to cancel her plans.",
    "constraints": "The refund should be processed as soon as possible, and Emily would like to receive an email confirmation once the refund has been successfully processed."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I need to cancel my trip to Florida from September 15th to September 22nd due to the hurricane warning. My trip includes a stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and a car rental from Avis. To proceed with the cancellation, could you first get_my_refund_status for both my hotel booking and car rental using get_rating_reviews_for_hotels and get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental? Then, please cancel my hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and my car rental using reserve_car_rental. Once the cancellations are confirmed, send me an email with the refund details using send_email.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not triggering any tools because it was too specific about the actions to be taken without providing enough context for retrieval tools to be called first. By rephrasing the prompt to include a retrieval tool call (get_rating_reviews_for_hotels and get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental) before the action tools (reserve_hotel, reserve_car_rental, and send_email), we ensure that both retrieval and action tools are utilized."
