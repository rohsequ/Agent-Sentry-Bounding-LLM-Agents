However, we can assume that the cost of car rentals will be additional to the total cost.\n\nTotal Maximum Expense for the 5-day trip: 3700.0 euros (hotels) + 520.0 euros (meals) = 4220.0 euros\n\nNote: The car rental costs are not included in the total maximum expense, as the prices are not provided. The actual cost of the trip may vary depending on the car rental prices and other factors.",
