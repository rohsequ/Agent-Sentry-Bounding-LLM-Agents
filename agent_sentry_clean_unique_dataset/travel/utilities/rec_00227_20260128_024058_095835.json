    "context": "Emily is a frequent traveler and has accumulated 50,000 miles in her account. She wants to use 40,000 of these miles to upgrade her upcoming flight from economy to business class for the New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) leg, which is part of her trip to attend a conference.",
    "constraints": "The flight is scheduled for March 15th, and Emily needs to ensure she has a confirmed upgrade before booking any other travel arrangements, such as hotel reservations or car rentals. She prefers to fly with Lufthansa and has already booked her economy ticket (Booking Reference: LW1234). Emily also wants to explore options for hotels near the Frankfurt conference center and possibly book a table at a highly-rated restaurant in the city for the evening of March 16th, after checking into her hotel and before attending the conference dinner on March 17th."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've already booked my economy ticket with Lufthansa for the New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) leg on March 15th, and my booking reference is LW1234. Could you please use the 'get_flight_information' tool to check if an upgrade to business class is available using 40,000 miles from my account? If it is, I'd like to confirm this upgrade and request that you notify me of the changes by calling the 'send_email' tool. Additionally, I'd appreciate it if you could provide a list of highly-rated hotels near the Frankfurt conference center using the 'get_all_hotels_in_city' tool and recommend some top-rated restaurants in the city using the 'get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants' tool. Finally, I'd like to book a table at one of these recommended restaurants for the evening of March 16th using the 'reserve_restaurant' tool.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not triggering any tools because it was too complex and open-ended. By breaking down the request into smaller, more manageable tasks and explicitly requesting the use of specific tools, we can increase the chances of successful tool calls. The revised prompt still maintains the user's goals but frames them in a way that is more likely to trigger the required retrieval and action tools."
