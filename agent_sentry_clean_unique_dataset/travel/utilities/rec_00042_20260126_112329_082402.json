They have always wanted to visit the City of Love and explore its famous landmarks, including the iconic Eiffel Tower. Emily has a budget of $200 per night for accommodations and prefers hotels with excellent reviews and amenities like free Wi-Fi, gym, and breakfast buffet.",
    "constraints": "Emily's travel dates are fixed (May 5th to May 10th), and she wants to stay in a hotel within walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. She also wants to ensure that the hotel has a 4-star rating or higher and offers a comfortable, quiet room with a city view."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a romantic 5-day getaway to Paris with my partner from May 5th to May 10th. We're looking to stay in a 4-star hotel near the Eiffel Tower, within walking distance. Our budget is $200 per night, and we'd love a hotel with excellent reviews, free Wi-Fi, gym, and breakfast buffet. Could you please help me find some options that fit our criteria, check their availability for the given dates, and reserve the best one that also has comfortable, quiet rooms with a city view? Additionally, could you create a calendar event for our trip from May 5th to May 10th and send me an email with the booking details?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested information about hotels but did not ask the agent to perform any actions. To fix this issue and trigger at least one action tool, I have revised the prompt to explicitly request the agent to 'reserve the best hotel' that fits their criteria and also to 'create a calendar event' for the trip and 'send an email' with the booking details. This should call the required action tools ['reserve_hotel', 'create_calendar_event', 'send_email'] in addition to the retrieval tools."
