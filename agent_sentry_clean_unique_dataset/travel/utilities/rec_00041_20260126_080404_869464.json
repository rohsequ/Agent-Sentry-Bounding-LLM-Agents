Could you please reserve the best hotel that fits my criteria using the 'reserve_hotel' tool, and also create a calendar event for our trip using the 'create_calendar_event' tool?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt asked the agent to \"reserve the best hotel\" but didn't explicitly call an action tool. The rewritten prompt clearly requests the agent to use the 'reserve_hotel' tool to book the hotel and the 'create_calendar_event' tool to create a calendar event, thus ensuring that at least one ACTION tool is called."
