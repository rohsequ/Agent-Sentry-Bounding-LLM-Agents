    "constraints": "Emily has access to her personal calendar and the company's travel agency account, but not to the calendars of individual team members. The agency uses the travel agent system for booking flights, hotels, and car rentals. Emily needs to confirm the dates by the end of the day to send out meeting invitations."

    "prompt": "Hi, I need to confirm the travel schedules of my team members for the next quarter. Can you please retrieve all upcoming trips booked through our company's travel agency account from today, March 6th, onwards and create a calendar event for our quarterly meeting on a day when no one is traveling? Additionally, send an email to all team members with their individual travel dates, including arrival and departure dates.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested retrieval of information, which led to the agent only calling the 'search_calendar_events' tool. To fix this issue, I have rewritten the prompt to explicitly request action tools, specifically 'create_calendar_event' and 'send_email'. This revised prompt asks the agent to not only retrieve the travel schedules but also create a calendar event for the quarterly meeting on a day when no team members are traveling and send an email to all team members with their individual travel dates."
