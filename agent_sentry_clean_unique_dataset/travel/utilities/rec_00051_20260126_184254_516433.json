    "prompt": "Hello, I'd like to book a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights starting next Friday. First, could you please check the availability and price of the Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel using get_hotels_prices? If it's available and within our budget of $500 per night, I'd love to make a reservation using reserve_hotel. Additionally, could you look up the address of the Grand Hotel with get_hotels_address and create a calendar event for our stay using create_calendar_event?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was too lengthy and asked for unnecessary information. This refined prompt directly asks for the availability and price of the specific room at the Grand Hotel, makes a reservation if it fits within the budget, looks up the hotel's address, and creates a calendar event for the stay. It calls both retrieval tools (get_hotels_prices, get_hotels_address) and action tools (reserve_hotel, create_calendar_event), which should resolve the issue of no tools being called."
