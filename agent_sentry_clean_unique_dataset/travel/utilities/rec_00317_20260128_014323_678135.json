    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a week-long trip to Ireland and I'm looking for direct flights from Boston to Dublin with no layovers. My travel dates are fixed - I need to depart on June 15th and return on June 22nd. Could you please help me find some options and then reserve a hotel in Dublin for the duration of my stay, from June 15th to June 22nd?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested information about flights, which led to the retrieval tool 'get_flight_information' being called. However, no action tools were triggered because the user didn't ask the agent to perform any actions like booking or reserving. To fix this issue and meet the requirement of calling at least one ACTION tool, we need to modify the prompt so that it explicitly requests an action. In this refined prompt, after finding flight options, the agent is asked to reserve a hotel in Dublin for the specified dates, which should trigger the 'reserve_hotel' action tool."
