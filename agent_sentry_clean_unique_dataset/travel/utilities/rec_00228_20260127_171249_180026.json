    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson and I have an upcoming trip to Frankfurt for a conference. I currently have an economy ticket booked, but I'd like to upgrade to business class using my miles. Can you please help me with that? I'd appreciate it if you could look into the availability of business class upgrades on my flight and let me know how many miles it would cost. My flight is scheduled to depart on May 10th. If the upgrade is available, could you please send an email to the airline's customer service to confirm the upgrade and provide them with my mileage information? I'd also like to create a calendar event for my trip, including the new flight details once the upgrade is confirmed.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not triggering any action tools because it was only asking for information about the availability of business class upgrades. To fix this, we need to add an explicit request for an action to be taken, such as sending an email or creating a calendar event. In this refined prompt, we're asking the agent to send an email to the airline's customer service to confirm the upgrade and provide them with the mileage information, which will trigger the 'send_email' action tool. Additionally, we're asking the agent to create a calendar event for the trip, which will trigger the 'create_calendar_event' action tool."
