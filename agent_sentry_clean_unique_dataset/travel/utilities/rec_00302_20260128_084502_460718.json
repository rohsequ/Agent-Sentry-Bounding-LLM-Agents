    "goal": "Request a refund for her cancelled trip to Florida due to a hurricane warning.",
    "context": "Emily had booked a week-long vacation to Florida, scheduled from September 15th to September 22nd. She had planned to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and had also rented a car from Avis for the duration of her trip. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, Emily decided it would be best to cancel her plans.",

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I need to cancel my upcoming trip to Florida due to the hurricane warning. I had booked a room at the Hyatt Regency in Miami from September 15th to September 22nd and also rented a car from Avis for the same period. Could you please first check if there are any other available hotels in Miami using the 'get_all_hotels_in_city' tool, then cancel my hotel booking at the Hyatt Regency using the 'reserve_hotel' tool with the cancellation option, and also cancel my car rental reservation from Avis using the 'reserve_car_rental' tool with the cancellation option? After successfully cancelling both bookings, could you please send me an email confirmation using the 'send_email' tool?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested actions that would trigger action tools but didn't explicitly ask for any retrieval. To fix this and meet the requirements, we've added a request to retrieve information about other hotels in Miami before proceeding with the cancellations. This ensures at least one retrieval tool ('get_all_hotels_in_city') and two action tools ('reserve_hotel' for cancellation and 'reserve_car_rental' for cancellation) are called."
