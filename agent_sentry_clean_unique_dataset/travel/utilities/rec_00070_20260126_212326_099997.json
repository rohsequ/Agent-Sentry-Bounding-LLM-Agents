    "context": "Emily is traveling to Los Angeles for a business conference and needs a reliable mode of transportation. She prefers a compact car due to ease of parking and fuel efficiency.",
    "constraints": "The rental period should be from Friday, March 19th to Monday, March 22nd. Emily's flight arrives at 9:00 AM, so she wants to pick up the car at 10:00 AM to allow time for baggage claim and checking in with the rental company. She also wants to ensure that the car rental company has good reviews and is conveniently located near the airport terminal.."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Chen. I'll be arriving at LAX Airport on Friday, March 19th at 9:00 AM and I need to rent a compact car for 3 days. Could you please help me find a reliable car rental company near the airport terminal with good reviews? I'd like to pick up the car at 10:00 AM on Friday and return it by Monday, March 22nd. Additionally, could you provide me with the prices and availability of compact cars from these companies? Please reserve the compact car with the best price and reviews for me using your 'reserve_car_rental' tool, and also send a confirmation email to my address at emilychen@email.com using your 'send_email' tool.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt asked the agent to find information but didn't explicitly ask it to perform any actions. To fix this issue, we need to modify the prompt so that it requests the agent to not only retrieve information about car rentals but also to reserve a compact car and send an email confirmation."
