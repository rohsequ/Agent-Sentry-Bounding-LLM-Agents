    "prompt": "Hello, I'm planning a special weekend getaway with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. Could you please check the availability and price of a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights starting next Friday? If it's available and within our budget of $500 per night, please reserve the room using the 'reserve_hotel' tool and create a calendar event for our stay using the 'create_calendar_event' tool. Finally, send me a confirmation email with the booking details using the 'send_email' tool.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not specific enough in requesting an action from the agent. It only asked to \"check the availability\" and \"reserve it if the price is within our budget\", but did not explicitly state which tools to use for these actions. The revised prompt clearly requests the agent to use 'get_hotels_prices' to check the price, 'reserve_hotel' to book the room, 'create_calendar_event' to create a calendar event, and 'send_email' to send a confirmation email."
