    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I need to rent a compact car at LAX Airport for 3 days, starting from this Friday, March 19th, at 10:00 AM sharp. Could you please reserve the most reliable and fuel-efficient option available for me using the reserve_car_rental tool? I'd appreciate it if you could also confirm the availability of the car for pick-up at the specified time, send me a confirmation email with the reservation details using the send_email tool, and create a calendar event for the rental period using the create_calendar_event tool.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not explicit enough in requesting an action from the agent. By specifying the use of the reserve_car_rental, send_email, and create_calendar_event tools, we ensure that the agent understands the need to perform specific actions rather than just retrieving information. This should trigger the required action tools and achieve the desired outcome."
