    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a special weekend getaway with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. We're looking for a luxurious stay, and I'm interested in booking a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights starting next Friday. Could you please check if this room type is available during that time frame and confirm the price? Our budget is $500 per night, so I'd like to make sure it fits within that range. If everything looks good, I'd love to go ahead and make a reservation using the 'reserve_hotel' tool. Additionally, could you also create a calendar event for our stay using the 'create_calendar_event' tool?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only triggered a retrieval tool ('get_hotels_prices') but did not trigger any action tools. To fix this, the refined prompt explicitly requests an action ('make a reservation') and specifies the tool to use ('reserve_hotel'). Furthermore, it also requests another action ('create a calendar event') using the 'create_calendar_event' tool to ensure that at least one action tool is called."
