    "goal": "Request a refund for a cancelled trip to Florida due to hurricane warning.",
    "context": "Emily had booked a 5-day vacation in Miami, Florida from September 15th to September 20th. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for South Florida, she wants to cancel her trip and get a full refund.",
    "constraints": "The cancellation policy of the airline and hotel should allow for refunds due to natural disasters like hurricanes."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I recently booked a 5-day trip to Miami, Florida from September 15th to September 20th, but due to the recent hurricane warning issued for South Florida, I'd like to cancel my trip and request a full refund. Could you please assist me with this? I've booked a flight and a hotel room, so I'll need to cancel both and get refunds for each. My flight details are: departure on September 15th from New York to Miami International Airport, and return on September 20th from Miami International Airport to New York. My hotel booking is at the Hyatt Regency in Miami. I'd appreciate it if you could look into the cancellation policies for both the airline and the hotel, considering the hurricane warning, and process my refunds as soon as possible by sending me a confirmation email with the refund details.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not triggering any action tools because it was only asking for information and assistance without explicitly requesting an action. By adding 'by sending me a confirmation email with the refund details' to the end of the prompt, we are now requesting the agent to perform an action using the 'send_email' tool, which should trigger at least one ACTION tool call."
