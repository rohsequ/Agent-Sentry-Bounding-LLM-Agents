    "prompt": "Hi, I need to cancel my upcoming flight to Chicago as my meeting has been called off. The flight was booked for a business trip and I would like to proceed with the cancellation as soon as possible. Could you please first retrieve my flight information using get_flight_information, and then assist me in cancelling it? Additionally, since my meeting is no longer happening, could you also cancel the corresponding calendar event using cancel_calendar_event?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt did not trigger any retrieval tools. To fix this issue, we need to explicitly request a retrieval action, such as getting flight information, before proceeding with the cancellation. This ensures that at least one RETRIEVAL tool and one ACTION tool are called."
