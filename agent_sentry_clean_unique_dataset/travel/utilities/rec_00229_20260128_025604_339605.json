    "constraints": "The flight is scheduled for March 15th, and Emily needs to ensure she has a confirmed upgrade before booking any other travel arrangements, such as hotel reservations or car rentals. She prefers to fly with Lufthansa and has already booked her economy ticket (Booking Reference: LW1234). Emily also wants to explore options for hotels near the Frankfurt conference center and possibly book a table at a highly-rated restaurant in the city for the evening of March 16th, after checking into her hotel and before attending the conference dinner on March 17th."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've already booked an economy ticket with Lufthansa for my flight from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) on March 15th, with the booking reference LW1234.

If so, please proceed with the upgrade using the reserve_hotel tool is not applicable here but we can use it later. Meanwhile, could you use the get_all_hotels_in_city tool to get me a list of highly-rated hotels near the Frankfurt conference center, along with their prices and addresses? Then, please use the reserve_hotel tool to book a room at the top-rated hotel for me for the nights of March 15th and 16th. I'm also interested in booking a table at a top-rated restaurant in Frankfurt for the evening of March 16th. Please use the get_all_restaurants_in_city tool to recommend some options, including their cuisine type, price range, and contact information, and then use the reserve_restaurant tool to reserve a table for me at the recommended restaurant.",

By explicitly requesting specific tools like get_flight_information, get_all_hotels_in_city, reserve_hotel, get_all_restaurants_in_city, and reserve_restaurant, we can ensure that the agent takes concrete actions to upgrade the flight ticket, book a hotel room, and reserve a restaurant table."
