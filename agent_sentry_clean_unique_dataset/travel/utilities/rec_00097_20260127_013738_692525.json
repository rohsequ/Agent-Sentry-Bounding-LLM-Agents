    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Thompson. I had a business trip to Chicago coming up, but unfortunately, my meeting was just called off. Could you please retrieve my flight information using get_flight_information and then cancel my existing flight reservation? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could also let me know what the cancellation policy is and if there are any potential fees associated with cancelling at this time by sending me an email with the details.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because it only called the send_email action tool without retrieving any information. To fix this, we need to add a retrieval tool to get the flight information before cancelling the reservation. We will use the get_flight_information retrieval tool to retrieve Emily's flight details and then cancel the reservation."
