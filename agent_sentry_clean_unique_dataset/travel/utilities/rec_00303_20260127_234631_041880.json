    "context": "Emily had booked a 5-day vacation in Miami, Florida from September 15th to September 20th. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for South Florida, she wants to cancel her trip and get a full refund.",
    "constraints": "The cancellation policy of the airline and hotel should allow for refunds due to natural disasters like hurricanes."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I need to cancel my upcoming trip to Miami, Florida due to the recent hurricane warning. The trip was scheduled from September 15th to September 20th, and I had booked a flight from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport to Miami International Airport, returning from Miami International Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. Additionally, I have a hotel reservation at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach in Miami. Could you please assist me by sending an email to the airline and the hotel to request a full refund for both the flight and the hotel stay? I would also like you to cancel any associated calendar events related to this trip.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not successful because it only called retrieval tools, but no action tools. To fix this issue, we need to rewrite the prompt to explicitly request an action. In this case, we ask the agent to send an email to the airline and the hotel to request a refund, which should trigger the 'send_email' action tool. Additionally, we request the agent to cancel any associated calendar events related to the trip, which should trigger the 'cancel_calendar_event' action tool."
