    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a special weekend getaway with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. I'd like to make a reservation for a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for next Friday and Saturday nights. Could you please check if they have availability for those dates, confirm that the rate is within our budget of $500 per night using get_hotels_prices, and then reserve the room using reserve_hotel? Additionally, could you create a calendar event using create_calendar_event to remind us of our upcoming stay?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only called a retrieval tool (get_hotels_prices) but didn't trigger any action tools. To fix this, we need to explicitly request an action (reserving the hotel room) and also call a retrieval tool to check availability and price. We'll use reserve_hotel to book the room and create_calendar_event to create a reminder."
