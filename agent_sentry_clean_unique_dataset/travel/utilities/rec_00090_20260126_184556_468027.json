Could you please assist me with that by calling the 'cancel_calendar_event' tool for my flight and then send a confirmation email to my address on file using the 'send_email' tool?",

The rewritten prompt explicitly requests the agent to call the 'cancel_calendar_event' tool to cancel the flight reservation and the 'send_email' tool to send a confirmation email. This should trigger at least one ACTION tool call."
