Could you please check if this room type is available during that time by using get_hotels_prices and get_rating_reviews_for_hotels? If it fits within our budget of $500 per night, I'd like to make a reservation using reserve_hotel and also create a calendar event with create_calendar_event to remind us of the booking.",

By adding get_hotels_prices and get_rating_reviews_for_hotels, we can ensure that at least one RETRIEVAL tool is called before making the reservation. Additionally, creating a calendar event with create_calendar_event will help trigger another ACTION tool."
