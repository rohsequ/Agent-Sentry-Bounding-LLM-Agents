    "context": "Emily had booked a week-long vacation to Florida, scheduled from September 15th to September 22nd. She had planned to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and had also rented a car from Avis for the duration of her trip. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, Emily decided it would be best to cancel her plans.",

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I recently booked a week-long vacation to Florida from September 15th to September 22nd, which included a stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and a car rental from Avis. However, due to the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, I've decided to cancel my trip. Could you please assist me in requesting a refund for my cancelled bookings as soon as possible? First, could you check if the Hyatt Regency in Miami and Avis are still operating under these circumstances using get_hotels_address and get_car_rental_address? Then, proceed with cancelling my hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and car rental booking using reserve_car_rental. After that, send me an email confirmation once the refund has been successfully processed.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt did not trigger any retrieval tools. To fix this issue, we need to explicitly request the agent to retrieve some information before taking action. In this case, we ask the agent to check if the Hyatt Regency in Miami and Avis are still operating using get_hotels_address and get_car_rental_address. Then, we proceed with cancelling the hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and car rental booking using reserve_car_rental. Finally, we request the agent to send an email confirmation once the refund has been successfully processed using send_email."
