By explicitly mentioning the required action tools ('cancel_calendar_event', 'create_calendar_event', 'reserve_hotel', 'reserve_car_rental', and 'send_email') and providing clear instructions, we can ensure that the agent takes the necessary actions to modify the flight booking and make the additional reservations."
