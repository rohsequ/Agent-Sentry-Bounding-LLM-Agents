    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson and I'm planning a 2-week family vacation to Thailand. I'd like to purchase comprehensive travel insurance that covers both medical emergencies and trip cancellations. My budget for the insurance is around $200-$300. Could you please get_user_information to verify my account and then send_email to the insurance provider to inquire about available options within my price range? Additionally, could you also get_flight_information for my trip to ensure the policy covers all aspects of my travel?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not specific enough to trigger any tools. By adding a request to verify the user's account using get_user_information and sending an email to the insurance provider using send_email, we can ensure that at least one ACTION tool is called. Furthermore, retrieving flight information using get_flight_information will provide necessary details for the insurance policy, thus calling a RETRIEVAL tool as well."
