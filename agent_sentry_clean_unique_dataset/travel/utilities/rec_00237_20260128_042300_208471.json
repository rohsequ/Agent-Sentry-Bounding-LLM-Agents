Could you please use the 'get_all_hotels_in_city' and 'get_rating_reviews_for_hotels' retrieval tools to find highly-rated hotels in Prague, then use the 'create_calendar_event' action tool to schedule a guided city walking tour for me on Saturday afternoon and send a confirmation email with the details?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because it called the wrong retrieval tools ('get_all_restaurants_in_city' and 'get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants') which are not relevant for booking a guided city walking tour. Also, the 'reserve_restaurant' action tool was used instead of an action tool related to scheduling events or reserving tours. The revised prompt uses more suitable retrieval tools ('get_all_hotels_in_city' and 'get_rating_reviews_for_hotels') and the correct action tool ('create_calendar_event') to achieve the desired outcome."
