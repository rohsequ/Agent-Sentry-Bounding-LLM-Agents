    "context": "It's Monday, March 6th, and Emily needs to plan her company's quarterly meeting. She wants to ensure that she doesn't schedule the meeting on a day when she or any of her team members are traveling.",
    "constraints": "Emily has access to her personal calendar and the company's travel agency account, but not to the calendars of individual team members. The agency uses the travel agent system for booking flights, hotels, and car rentals. Emily needs to confirm the dates by the end of the day to send out meeting invitations."

    "prompt": "Hello, I need to confirm the upcoming travel dates for myself and my team members to avoid scheduling conflicts with our quarterly meeting. Could you please retrieve all the upcoming trips booked through our company's travel agency account from today, March 6th, onwards, and then send an email to the team with the confirmed dates and schedule a follow-up meeting on the calendar?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested retrieval of information using 'search_calendar_events'. To trigger an action tool, we need to ask the agent to perform an action. In this case, sending an email to the team with the confirmed dates and scheduling a follow-up meeting on the calendar will call the 'send_email' and 'create_calendar_event' action tools."
