    "goal": "Request a refund for her cancelled trip to Florida due to a hurricane warning.",
    "context": "Emily had booked a week-long vacation to Florida, scheduled from September 15th to September 22nd. She had planned to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and had also rented a car from Avis for the duration of her trip. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, Emily decided it would be best to cancel her plans.",

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I recently booked a vacation to Florida from September 15th to September 22nd, which included a stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and a car rental from Avis. However, due to the hurricane warning issued for the state, I've decided to cancel my trip. Could you please assist me in requesting a refund for my cancelled bookings as soon as possible? First, could you get_rating_reviews_for_hotels for the Hyatt Regency in Miami and get_car_rental_address for Avis in Miami to confirm my bookings? Then, I would appreciate it if you could cancel my hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and car rental reservation using reserve_car_rental. Once the refunds have been successfully processed, please send me an email confirmation.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was missing a retrieval tool call. In this rewritten prompt, we first call get_rating_reviews_for_hotels to retrieve reviews for the Hyatt Regency in Miami and get_car_rental_address to confirm the address of Avis in Miami. This ensures that at least one RETRIEVAL tool is called. Then, we request the agent to cancel the hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and car rental reservation using reserve_car_rental, which are ACTION tools. Finally, we ask the agent to send an email confirmation once the refunds have been processed, which calls the send_email ACTION tool."
