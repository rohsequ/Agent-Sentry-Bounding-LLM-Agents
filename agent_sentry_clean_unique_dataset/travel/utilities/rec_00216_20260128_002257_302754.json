She prefers to fly with Lufthansa and has already booked her economy ticket (Booking Reference: LW1234). Emily also wants to explore options for hotels near the Frankfurt conference center and possibly book a table at a highly-rated restaurant in the city for the evening of March 16th, after checking into her hotel and before attending the conference dinner on March 17th."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I've already booked an economy ticket with Lufthansa for my flight from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) on March 15th, with the booking reference LW1234. I'd like to upgrade this ticket to business class using 40,000 miles from my account, which currently has 50,000 miles. Could you please check if this upgrade is available and confirm it for me? Additionally, could you provide a list of highly-rated hotels near the Frankfurt conference center, along with their prices and addresses?

Could you recommend some options based on excellent reviews and provide me with their contact information, cuisine type, and price range?",
