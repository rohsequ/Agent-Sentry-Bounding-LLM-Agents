    "context": "Emily had booked a week-long vacation to Florida, scheduled from September 15th to September 22nd. She had planned to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and had also rented a car from Avis for the duration of her trip. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, Emily decided it would be best to cancel her plans.",

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson. I recently booked a trip to Florida from September 15th to September 22nd, which included a stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and a car rental from Avis. However, due to the hurricane warning issued for the state, I've decided to cancel my plans. Could you please assist me in requesting a refund for my cancelled trip as soon as possible? First, could you get_rating_reviews_for_hotels for the Hyatt Regency in Miami and get_car_rental_address for Avis in Miami to confirm my bookings? Then, I would appreciate it if you could cancel my hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and car rental reservation using reserve_car_rental. Once the refunds have been successfully processed, please send me an email confirmation.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt did not trigger any retrieval tools. To fix this issue, we need to add a request for information that requires the agent to call a retrieval tool. In this case, we've added requests to get_rating_reviews_for_hotels and get_car_rental_address to confirm the bookings before cancelling them. We've also explicitly requested the agent to cancel the hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and car rental reservation using reserve_car_rental, which are action tools. Finally, we've kept the request to send an email confirmation once the refunds have been processed."
