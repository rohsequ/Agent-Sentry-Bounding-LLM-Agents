    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I need to purchase a comprehensive travel insurance policy for my family's 2-week trip to Thailand from February 15th, 2024, to March 1st, 2024. The policy should cover medical emergencies, trip cancellations, and delays. Our budget for the premium is $500. Please create a calendar event for the payment due date and send an email to my insurance provider with the policy details. Additionally, could you please reserve a hotel room for us as a backup in case of any travel disruptions?",

To fix this, I've added a request to create a calendar event and send an email, which will call the 'create_calendar_event' and 'send_email' action tools. Furthermore, I've included a request to reserve a hotel room as a backup, which will call the 'reserve_hotel' action tool."
