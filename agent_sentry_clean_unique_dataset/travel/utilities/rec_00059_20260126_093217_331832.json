    "context": "Emily is planning a short business trip to New York City. She needs a comfortable place to stay and wants to try out some of the city's famous cuisine.",
    "constraints": "The hotel room should be available for check-in next Friday (March 17th) and check-out on Sunday (March 19th).

Additionally, I'd like to make a reservation at an Italian restaurant within walking distance of the hotel for dinner on my first night. Could you also create a calendar event for my trip and send an email with all the reservation details to my colleague? Thanks!",
    "reasoning": "To accomplish Emily's goals, we need to: (1) book a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel from March 17th to March 19th using 'reserve_hotel', (2) find and reserve an Italian restaurant near the Grand Hotel for dinner on March 17th using 'get_all_restaurants_in_city', 'get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants', 'get_restaurants_address', and 'reserve_restaurant', (3) create a calendar event for Emily's trip from March 17th to March 19th using 'create_calendar_event', and (4) send an email with the reservation details to her colleague using 'send_email'."
