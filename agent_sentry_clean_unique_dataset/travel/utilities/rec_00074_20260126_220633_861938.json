    "constraints": "The rental period should be from Friday, March 19th to Monday, March 22nd. Emily's flight arrives at 9:00 AM, so she wants to pick up the car at 10:00 AM to allow time for baggage claim and checking in with the rental company. She also wants to ensure that the car rental company has good reviews and is conveniently located near the airport terminal.."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Chen and I'll be arriving at LAX Airport on Friday, March 19th at 9:00 AM. I need to rent a compact car for 3 days, from March 19th to March 22nd, with a pick-up time of 10:00 AM on the 19th. Could you please help me find a reliable car rental company near the airport terminal with good reviews and reserve the car for me? I'd like to know the available options, their addresses, and prices per day. Please go ahead and book the most affordable option that suits my needs.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested information about car rental companies, but did not ask the agent to take any action. To fix this issue, the rewritten prompt explicitly asks the agent to 'reserve the car' which should trigger an ACTION tool call ('reserve_car_rental'). Additionally, the prompt still requests retrieval of information about available options, addresses, and prices per day, ensuring that at least one RETRIEVAL tool is called."
