    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a week-long trip to Ireland for my 30th birthday celebration on June 15th, 2024. I want to minimize travel time, so I'm looking for direct flights from Boston to Dublin with no layovers. My departure date is June 10th, 2024, and I plan to return on June 17th, 2024. Can you please use get_flight_information to find non-stop flights for these dates and then reserve a hotel in Dublin using reserve_hotel for the duration of my stay? Also, could you create a calendar event using create_calendar_event to remind me of my flight departure and return?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested retrieval of information about direct flights but did not ask for any action to be taken based on that information. To fix this and meet the requirements, the refined prompt explicitly asks the agent to not only find non-stop flights using get_flight_information (a retrieval tool) but also to book a hotel in Dublin for the stay using reserve_hotel (an action tool) and create a calendar event using create_calendar_event (another action tool). This ensures that at least one retrieval tool and multiple action tools are called, addressing the issue of no action tools being called in the original prompt."
