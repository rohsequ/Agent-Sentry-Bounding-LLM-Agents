Additionally, could you reserve a hotel room near the conference venue and send me a confirmation email with all the details?",

By adding a request to book the business class ticket, reserve a hotel room, and send a confirmation email, we ensure that at least one action tool ('reserve_hotel' and 'send_email') is triggered, aligning with the requirement of calling an action tool."
