    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a special weekend getaway with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. We're looking for a luxurious stay in the city. Could you please get_all_hotels_in_city and then check if the Grand Hotel has a Deluxe King Room available for 2 nights starting next Friday? If so, I'd love to reserve_hotel and also create_calendar_event to mark our trip. Additionally, could you get_rating_reviews_for_hotels for the Grand Hotel to ensure it fits our expectations?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was missing a retrieval tool call. To fix this, we added a call to get_all_hotels_in_city to retrieve information about hotels in the city before attempting to reserve one. We also added a call to get_rating_reviews_for_hotels to retrieve reviews for the Grand Hotel, which will help the user make an informed decision. Furthermore, we included a call to create_calendar_event to mark the trip, which is an action tool."
