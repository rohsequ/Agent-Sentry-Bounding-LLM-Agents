As I'm flexible with travel dates between March 20th and March 25th, could you please search for available flights using 'get_flight_information' and then book the best option for me? Additionally, arrange for a car rental in Miami using 'reserve_car_rental' and send me a confirmation email with the details of my new flight and car rental bookings.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only triggered a retrieval tool ('get_flight_information') but didn't result in any action being taken. To fix this, the refined prompt explicitly requests two actions: booking a flight and reserving a car rental in Miami, while also utilizing 'get_flight_information' for searching available flights. This should trigger both a retrieval tool and an action tool."
