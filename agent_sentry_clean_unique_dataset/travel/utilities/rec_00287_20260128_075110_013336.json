I recently booked a week-long vacation to Florida from September 15th to September 22nd, which included a stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and a car rental from Avis. However, due to the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, I've decided to cancel my trip. Could you please assist me in obtaining a refund for my cancelled bookings as soon as possible? First, could you get_rating_reviews_for_hotels for the Hyatt Regency in Miami and get_car_rental_address for Avis in Florida to confirm my bookings? Then, proceed with cancelling my hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and car rental booking using reserve_car_rental. Once the cancellations are successful, please send me an email confirmation using send_email.",

To address this issue, I added requests to get_rating_reviews_for_hotels for the Hyatt Regency in Miami and get_car_rental_address for Avis in Florida. These actions will confirm Emily's bookings before proceeding with the cancellations. After retrieving the necessary information, I requested the agent to cancel the hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and car rental booking using reserve_car_rental, followed by sending an email confirmation using send_email."

However, we can guide you through the process of contacting Hyatt Regency and Avis to request cancellations.\n\nTo cancel your hotel reservation at the Hyatt Regency in Miami, please contact them directly using their phone number or email address. When calling, let them know that you would like to cancel your reservation from September 15th to September 22nd due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, for cancelling your car rental booking from Avis, reach out to the location where you made the reservation and provide your booking details to initiate the cancellation process.\n\nOnce you have successfully cancelled both bookings, we recommend verifying with Hyatt Regency and Avis that refunds are being processed. Refunds may take a few days to reflect in your account.\n\nPlease let us know if there's anything else we can assist you with during this time.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n\nP.S.
