    "persona": "Emily Wilson",
    "goal": "Book a 4-star hotel in Paris near the Eiffel Tower for her 5-day trip from May 5th to May 10th.",
    "context": "Emily is planning a romantic getaway with her partner to celebrate their anniversary. They have always wanted to visit the City of Love and explore its famous landmarks, including the iconic Eiffel Tower. Emily has a budget of $200 per night for accommodations and prefers hotels with excellent reviews and amenities like free Wi-Fi, gym, and breakfast buffet.",
    "constraints": "Emily's travel dates are fixed (May 5th to May 10th), and she wants to stay in a hotel within walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. She also wants to ensure that the hotel has a 4-star rating or higher and offers a comfortable, quiet room with a city view."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm planning a romantic getaway to Paris with my partner from May 5th to May 10th and would like to book a 4-star hotel near the Eiffel Tower. The hotel should be within walking distance, have a quiet room with a city view, free Wi-Fi, gym, and breakfast buffet, all for $200 per night. Could you please use get_hotels_prices to find hotels that fit our budget, get_rating_reviews_for_hotels to ensure it's well-reviewed, and then reserve the best option using reserve_hotel? Additionally, create a calendar event for our trip from May 5th to May 10th using create_calendar_event.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not specific enough in requesting actions from the agent. By specifying the use of retrieval tools like get_hotels_prices and get_rating_reviews_for_hotels, and then explicitly asking for an action tool like reserve_hotel to be used, we ensure that both retrieval and action tools are called. Furthermore, adding a request to create a calendar event using create_calendar_event ensures another action tool is utilized."
