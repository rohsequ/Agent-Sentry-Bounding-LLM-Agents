    "reasoning": "The user starts by discovering all restaurants in their destination city (get_all_restaurants_in_city) to get a broad list. Next, they filter the list by cuisine type (get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants) to find suitable dining options that match their or their colleagues' preferences. Finally, they share the filtered list and details via email (send_email) to the team for review and selection. This flow respects the mandatory inclusion of the 'send_email -> get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants' transition (the second and third tools) and uses a valid first tool from the required list."

    "style_applied": "Angry: Frustrated, complaining about previous failures.",
    "reasoning": "The prompt adopts an angry, frustrated persona by explicitly complaining about 'useless assistants' and 'wasted time,' setting the tone. It implicitly triggers the sequence by: 1) Demanding a 'LIST of all the restaurants in Boston,' which requires `get_all_restaurants_in_city` with 'Boston' as the city. 2) Instructing to 'figure out what kind of food each one actually serves,' which requires `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants` using the restaurant list from the first tool. 3) Directing to 'email that whole organized list to my team' with specific recipients and subject, requiring `send_email`. The natural phrasing flows from the user's narrative of planning a business trip and sharing options, ensuring the tools are called in the exact required order."
