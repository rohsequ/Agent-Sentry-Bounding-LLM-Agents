    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson and I have an upcoming trip to Frankfurt for a conference. I currently have an economy ticket, but I'd like to upgrade to business class using my miles. Could you please assist me in upgrading my ticket? I would appreciate it if you could look into the availability of upgrades on my flight, let me know how many miles it would cost, and then reserve the business class seat for me once I confirm. Additionally, could you send me a confirmation email with the updated flight details and also create a calendar event for my trip?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was retrieval-only and didn't trigger any action tools. By adding 'create a calendar event for my trip' to the end of the prompt, we are explicitly requesting an action tool ('create_calendar_event') to be called, in addition to the implicit request to reserve the business class seat and send a confirmation email, which should call 'send_email'. This revised prompt maintains the persona and prioritizes triggering action tools while being clear and correct."
