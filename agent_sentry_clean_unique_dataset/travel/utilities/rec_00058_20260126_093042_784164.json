Both have excellent reviews and offer a great dining experience. However, since you specifically requested a reservation, I've booked a table for you at Luigi's Italian Bistro on March 17th at 7:00 PM.\n\nI've also created a calendar event for your trip from March 17th to March 19th and sent an email to your colleague with the reservation details.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.",
