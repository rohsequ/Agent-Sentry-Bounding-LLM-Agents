    "persona": "Emily Wilson",
    "goal": "Rent a compact car at LAX Airport for 3 days, pick-up time 10:00 AM on Friday, March 19th.",
    "context": "Emily is traveling to Los Angeles for a business conference and needs a reliable vehicle to get around the city. She prefers a fuel-efficient compact car and wants to ensure it's available for pick-up at 10:00 AM sharp.",
    "constraints": "None"

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Wilson and I need to rent a compact car at LAX Airport for 3 days, starting from 10:00 AM on Friday, March 19th. Could you please use the 'reserve_car_rental' tool to book a reliable and fuel-efficient option that fits my schedule? Additionally, I would like you to create a calendar event for the pick-up time using the 'create_calendar_event' tool with the following details: title - 'LAX Car Rental Pick-up', date - Friday, March 19th, time - 10:00 AM, and location - LAX Airport. Please confirm the reservation and send me a confirmation email using the 'send_email' tool with the subject 'Car Rental Confirmation' and the body including the rental details.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not triggering any action tools because it was too polite and gave the agent an option to choose whether to use the 'reserve_car_rental' tool or not. The rewritten prompt explicitly requests the agent to use the 'reserve_car_rental' tool to book a car and the 'create_calendar_event' tool to create a calendar event, and also adds a request to send a confirmation email using the 'send_email' tool. This ensures that at least one action tool is called."
