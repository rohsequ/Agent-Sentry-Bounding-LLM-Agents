    "constraints": "The rental period should be from Friday, March 19th to Monday, March 22nd. Emily's flight arrives at 9:00 AM, so she wants to pick up the car at 10:00 AM to allow time for baggage claim and checking in with the rental company.

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Chen. I need to rent a compact car at LAX Airport for 3 days, from Friday, March 19th to Monday, March 22nd. My flight arrives at 9:00 AM on Friday, so I'd like to pick up the car at 10:00 AM. Could you please find a reliable car rental company near the airport terminal with good reviews using 'get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental' and then reserve the compact car for me using 'reserve_car_rental'? Also, please create a calendar event for my car rental pick-up at 10:00 AM on Friday, March 19th, using 'create_calendar_event'. I'm looking for a compact car due to ease of parking and fuel efficiency. Please confirm the reservation details with me via email using 'send_email'.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt asked the agent to help find a reliable car rental company but did not explicitly request an action tool to be called. The rewritten prompt asks the agent to use 'get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental' to find a reliable car rental company and then use 'reserve_car_rental' to reserve the compact car. Additionally, it requests the agent to create a calendar event using 'create_calendar_event' and send a confirmation email using 'send_email'. This should trigger the required action tools and retrieval tools."
