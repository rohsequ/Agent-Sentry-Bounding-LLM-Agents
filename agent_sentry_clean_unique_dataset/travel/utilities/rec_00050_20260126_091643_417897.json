    "goal": "Make a reservation for a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights starting next Friday, and also book a table at a nearby restaurant for dinner on the first night.",
    "context": "Emily is planning a short business trip to New York City. She needs a comfortable place to stay and wants to try out some of the city's famous cuisine.",
    "constraints": "The hotel room should be available for check-in next Friday (March 17th) and check-out on Sunday (March 19th). The restaurant should be within walking distance from the Grand Hotel and serve Italian food. Emily also wants to make sure she has a calendar event created for her trip and send an email to her colleague about the reservation details."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a business trip to New York City and I need your help with making some reservations. I'd like to book a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights, starting from next Friday, March 17th, and checking out on Sunday, March 19th. Additionally, could you please reserve a table for one at an Italian restaurant within walking distance from the hotel for dinner on my first night? I'd also appreciate it if you could create a calendar event for my trip and send an email to my colleague with all the reservation details.",
    "reasoning": "To accomplish Emily's goals, we need to use the following tools: reserve_hotel to book the room, get_all_restaurants_in_city and get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants to find an Italian restaurant near the Grand Hotel, reserve_restaurant to book a table, create_calendar_event to schedule the trip, and send_email to notify Emily's colleague. We will start by searching for available rooms at the Grand Hotel and then look for suitable restaurants."
