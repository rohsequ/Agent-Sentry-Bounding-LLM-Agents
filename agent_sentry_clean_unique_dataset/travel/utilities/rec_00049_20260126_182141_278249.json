    "prompt": "Hello, I'm planning a special weekend getaway with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. Could you please get the rating reviews for the Grand Hotel using the 'get_rating_reviews_for_hotels' tool and then check its address using the 'get_hotels_address' tool? After that, I'd like to make a reservation for a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights starting next Friday within my budget of $500 per night. Please use the 'reserve_hotel' tool to finalize the booking as soon as possible and let me know the total cost.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not able to trigger an action tool because it only asked for retrieval tools. To fix this, we need to make sure that the prompt explicitly requests an action. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the prompt does indeed ask for a reservation using the 'reserve_hotel' tool. The issue might be due to the fact that the agent was not able to understand the parameters or the context of the request."
