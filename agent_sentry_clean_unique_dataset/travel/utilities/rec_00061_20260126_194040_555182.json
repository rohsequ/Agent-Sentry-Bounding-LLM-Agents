We're looking for a luxurious stay, and I'm interested in booking a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights starting next Friday. Could you please check if this room type is available for those dates, confirm the price, and reserve the room if it's within our budget of $500 per night? Additionally, could you provide me with more details about the room amenities and services offered by the hotel, and also create a calendar event for our stay?",
