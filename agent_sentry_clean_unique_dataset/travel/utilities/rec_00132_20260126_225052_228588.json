Could you please retrieve all upcoming trips booked through our company's travel agency account from now until the end of June?

Then, based on this information, could you please create a new calendar event for our quarterly meeting, making sure it doesn't conflict with any existing trips, and send an email to all team members with the meeting details? Additionally, please reserve a hotel room for each team member attending the meeting and arrange for car rentals if necessary.",

To fix this, I added requests to create a new calendar event, send an email, reserve hotel rooms, and arrange for car rentals, which will call the 'create_calendar_event', 'send_email', 'reserve_hotel', and 'reserve_car_rental' action tools."
