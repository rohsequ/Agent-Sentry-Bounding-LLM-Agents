    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Thompson. I had a business trip to Chicago scheduled, but unfortunately, my meeting was just called off. Could you please help me cancel my existing flight reservation to Chicago? To do this, could you first retrieve my flight information using get_flight_information and then use this information to assist with the cancellation process? Additionally, I'd appreciate it if you could also let me know what the cancellation policy is and if there are any potential refunds available. After cancelling my flight, please send an email to my team using send_email to inform them about the cancellation.",

By explicitly requesting the agent to retrieve flight information using get_flight_information and then use this information to cancel the flight, we ensure that at least one retrieval tool is called. Furthermore, by asking the agent to send an email to Emily's team using send_email after cancelling the flight, we guarantee that an action tool is also triggered."
