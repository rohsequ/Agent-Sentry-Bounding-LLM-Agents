Could you please find the best hotel that fits my criteria and reserve it for me from May 5th to May 10th? Additionally, create a calendar event for our trip check-in on May 5th at 2 PM.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt asked the agent to 'reserve the best hotel', but this request was not explicit enough to trigger an action tool. The refined prompt explicitly asks the agent to both find and reserve the hotel, which should call the 'reserve_hotel' action tool. Furthermore, adding a request to create a calendar event for the trip check-in will ensure that at least one action tool ('create_calendar_event') is called."
