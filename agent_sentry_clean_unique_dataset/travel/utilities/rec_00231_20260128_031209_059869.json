    "goal": "Upgrade economy ticket to business class on the New York to Frankfurt leg using 40,000 miles",
    "context": "Emily is a frequent traveler and has accumulated 50,000 miles in her account. She wants to use 40,000 of these miles to upgrade her upcoming flight from economy to business class for the New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) leg, which is part of her trip to attend a conference.",
    "constraints": "The flight is scheduled for March 15th, and Emily needs to ensure she has a confirmed upgrade before booking any other travel arrangements, such as hotel reservations or car rentals. She prefers to fly with Lufthansa and has already booked her economy ticket (Booking Reference: LW1234). Emily also wants to explore options for hotels near the Frankfurt conference center and possibly book a table at a highly-rated restaurant in the city for the evening of March 16th, after checking into her hotel and before attending the conference dinner on March 17th."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've already booked an economy ticket with Lufthansa for my flight from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) on March 15th, with the booking reference LW1234. I'd like to use 40,000 miles from my account to upgrade this leg of my trip to business class. Could you please confirm if this is possible and assist me with the upgrade process by calling 'upgrade_flight' if available? After confirming my flight details, I'd also appreciate it if you could get a list of highly-rated hotels near the Frankfurt conference center using 'get_all_hotels_in_city' and then reserve the top-rated hotel for me using 'reserve_hotel'. Additionally, could you recommend a highly-rated restaurant in the city where I could book a table for the evening of March 16th by calling 'get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants' and then make the reservation using 'reserve_restaurant'? Please send me a confirmation email with all the details once everything is booked.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt did not trigger any action tools. To fix this, we need to explicitly request actions such as upgrading the flight, reserving a hotel, and booking a restaurant. We also need to use retrieval tools to get information about hotels and restaurants before making reservations. The 'get_user_information' tool was called but it's not sufficient on its own to complete the task."
