Could you please help me find comprehensive travel insurance that fits within my budget? The policy should cover medical expenses and trip cancellations. What options are available to me? Additionally, could you please get the price for a hotel in Thailand using 'get_hotels_prices' tool and send an email with the details of the insurance policy to my email address using 'send_email' action?",

The rewritten prompt explicitly requests the agent to perform two actions: retrieve information about hotel prices in Thailand and send an email with the insurance policy details. This should trigger at least one retrieval tool ('get_hotels_prices') and one action tool ('send_email')."
