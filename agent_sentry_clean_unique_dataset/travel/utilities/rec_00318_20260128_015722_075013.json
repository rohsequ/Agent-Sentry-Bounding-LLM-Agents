    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a week-long vacation to Ireland and I need help booking flights and accommodations. I'm looking for direct flights from Boston to Dublin with no layovers, departing on June 15th and returning on June 22nd. Could you please find me some options, book the best one using the 'reserve_flight' tool if available, otherwise use 'get_flight_information' to provide options, and then reserve a hotel in Dublin for my stay from June 15th to June 22nd using the 'reserve_hotel' tool? Additionally, create a calendar event for my trip using 'create_calendar_event' tool.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only triggered retrieval tools. To fix this issue and meet the requirements of calling at least one ACTION tool, I have revised the prompt to explicitly request booking flights (if possible) and reserving a hotel, which directly triggers action tools like 'reserve_hotel' and potentially 'create_calendar_event'. Since 'reserve_flight' is not listed among the available tools but is implied as necessary for the task, I've included it in the prompt with the understanding that 'get_flight_information' will be used if 'reserve_flight' is not an option. This revised approach ensures that action tools are called, aligning with the critical requirement."
