    "prompt": "Hello, I'm planning a 2-week family vacation to Thailand and I need comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical emergencies and trip cancellations. My budget is around $200-$300 for the entire policy. Could you please use get_user_information to confirm my personal details, then use get_flight_information to retrieve my flight schedule? After that, send_email to purchase a suitable travel insurance option within my price range and also reserve_hotel for our accommodation in Thailand.",

The rewritten prompt explicitly requests the agent to not only retrieve information using get_user_information and get_flight_information but also to take actions by sending an email to purchase travel insurance and reserving a hotel, thus fulfilling the requirement of calling at least one retrieval tool and one action tool."
