    "context": "Emily had booked a week-long vacation to Florida, scheduled from September 15th to September 22nd. She had planned to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and had also rented a car from Avis for the duration of her trip. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, Emily decided it would be best to cancel her plans.",

I had booked a room at the Hyatt Regency in Miami from September 15th to September 22nd and also rented a car from Avis for the same period. Could you please assist me in getting a refund for both the hotel booking and the car rental as soon as possible? First, could you get_rating_reviews_for_hotels and get_car_rental_address for my records? Then, I would appreciate it if you could send_email to confirm once the refund has been successfully processed and also cancel any calendar events related to this trip using cancel_calendar_event.",
