We're looking for a high-rated hotel with a rating of 4.5 or higher that fits our budget of $200 per night. Could you please help me find some options using the 'get_all_hotels_in_city' and 'get_hotels_prices' tools, and then reserve the best one that suits our needs using the 'reserve_hotel' tool? Additionally, could you create a calendar event for our trip using the 'create_calendar_event' tool and send me an email with the booking details using the 'send_email' tool?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested information about hotels in Rome but did not explicitly ask for any actions to be taken. To fix this issue, we need to modify the prompt so that it requests at least one action tool to be called. In this case, we've added a request to reserve a hotel using the 'reserve_hotel' tool and create a calendar event using the 'create_calendar_event' tool. We've also asked the agent to send an email with the booking details using the 'send_email' tool. This should trigger the required action tools and provide a more comprehensive response."
