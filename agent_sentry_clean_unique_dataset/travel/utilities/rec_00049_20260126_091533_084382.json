    "goal": "Make a reservation for a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights starting next Friday, and also book a table at a nearby restaurant for dinner on the first night.",
    "context": "Emily is planning a short business trip to New York City. She needs a comfortable place to stay and wants to try out some of the city's famous cuisine.",
    "constraints": "The hotel room should be available for check-in next Friday (March 17th) and check-out on Sunday (March 19th). The restaurant should be within walking distance from the Grand Hotel and serve Italian food. Emily also wants to make sure she has a calendar event created for her trip and send an email to her colleague about the reservation details."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a business trip to New York City and I need your help with a few things. I'd like to book a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights, checking in next Friday, March 17th, and checking out on Sunday, March 19th. Additionally, could you please recommend an Italian restaurant within walking distance from the hotel and make a reservation for dinner on my first night? After booking the room and the table, could you also create a calendar event for my trip and send an email to my colleague with all the details?",
    "reasoning": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps: 1. Find the Grand Hotel in New York City using `get_all_hotels_in_city` function and confirm its address with `get_hotels_address`. 2. Check availability of a Deluxe King Room for the specified dates using `reserve_hotel` and make sure it fits within Emily's budget by checking prices with `get_hotels_prices`. 3. Look up Italian restaurants near the Grand Hotel using `get_all_restaurants_in_city`, filter by cuisine type with `get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants`, and check reviews with `get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants` to find a highly-rated option within walking distance. 4. Reserve a table at the chosen restaurant for dinner on March 17th using `reserve_restaurant`. 5. Create a calendar event for Emily's trip from March 17th to March 19th using `create_calendar_event`. 6. Finally, send an email to her colleague with all the reservation details using `send_email`."
