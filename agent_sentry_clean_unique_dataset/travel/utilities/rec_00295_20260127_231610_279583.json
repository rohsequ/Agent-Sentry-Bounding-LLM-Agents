    "context": "Emily had booked a 5-day vacation in Miami, Florida from September 15th to September 20th. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for South Florida, she wants to cancel her trip and get a full refund.",
    "constraints": "The cancellation policy of the airline and hotel should allow for refunds due to natural disasters like hurricanes."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I need to cancel my upcoming 5-day trip to Miami, Florida from September 15th to September 20th due to the recent hurricane warning. Could you please use the 'cancel_calendar_event' tool to cancel my flight and hotel bookings, and then utilize the 'send_email' tool to notify the airline and hotel that I'm requesting a full refund? The cancellation policy allows for refunds in cases of natural disasters like hurricanes. Please include my booking reference number, which is #EW1234, in the email to expedite the process.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because it was too specific about the tools to be used and did not provide a clear call to action. The revised prompt still requests the use of specific tools but frames it as a direct request for assistance with cancelling the trip and obtaining a refund, which should trigger the required action tools."
