She had planned to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and had also rented a car from Avis for the duration of her trip. However, with the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, Emily decided it would be best to cancel her plans.",

    "prompt": "Hi, I\u2019m Emily Wilson. I recently booked a week-long vacation to Florida from September 15th to September 22nd, which included a stay at the Hyatt Regency in Miami and a car rental from Avis. However, due to the recent hurricane warning issued for the state, I\u2019ve decided to cancel my trip. Could you please assist me in requesting a refund for my cancelled bookings as soon as possible? First, could you get_rating_reviews_for_hotels for the Hyatt Regency in Miami and get_car_rental_address for Avis in Florida to confirm my bookings? Then, I would appreciate it if you could cancel my hotel reservation using reserve_hotel and car rental booking using reserve_car_rental. Once the refund has been successfully processed, please send me an email confirmation. Thank you.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt did not trigger any retrieval tools. To fix this issue, we need to add a request for information that requires a retrieval tool to be called before taking action. We also want to ensure that at least one ACTION tool is called. In the rewritten prompt, we first ask the agent to retrieve the rating reviews for the Hyatt Regency in Miami and the car rental address for Avis in Florida using get_rating_reviews_for_hotels and get_car_rental_address respectively. After confirming the bookings, we request the agent to cancel the hotel reservation and car rental booking using reserve_hotel and reserve_car_rental. Finally, we ask the agent to send an email confirmation once the refund has been processed."
