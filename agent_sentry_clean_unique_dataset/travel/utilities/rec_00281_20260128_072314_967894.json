    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not triggering any tools because it was too open-ended and didn't explicitly request specific actions. The refined prompt requests the agent to retrieve information about hotels in Bangkok using get_all_hotels_in_city, reserve a hotel for the first 3 nights using reserve_hotel, and send an email with the trip details using send_email. This should trigger at least one retrieval tool and one action tool."
