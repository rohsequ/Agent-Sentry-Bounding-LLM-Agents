    "goal": "To book a round-trip flight from San Francisco to Tokyo, departing on October 1st and returning on October 14th, while also exploring accommodation options in Tokyo.",
    "context": "Emily is planning a two-week trip to Japan for both business and leisure. She will attend a conference in Tokyo during the first week and plans to explore the city and its surroundings during her second week. Emily prefers flying with Japanese airlines and would like to stay in a hotel near the city center, ideally within walking distance to the conference venue.",

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm planning a trip to Tokyo from October 1st to October 14th and I need help with booking my flight and accommodation. I'd like to fly with a Japanese airline, such as Japan Airlines or All Nippon Airways, from San Francisco to Tokyo on October 1st and return on October 14th. My budget for the flight is $1,500. For accommodation, I'm looking for a hotel near the city center, within walking distance to my conference venue, with good reviews, free Wi-Fi, and breakfast. I'm willing to spend up to $200 per night. Could you please book the most suitable flight and reserve a hotel room that meets my requirements? Additionally, create a calendar event for my trip from October 1st to October 14th.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested information about flights and hotels but did not explicitly ask for any bookings or reservations. To trigger an action tool, the revised prompt asks the agent to book the flight and reserve a hotel room. Furthermore, it requests creating a calendar event for the trip, which should call the 'create_calendar_event' action tool."
