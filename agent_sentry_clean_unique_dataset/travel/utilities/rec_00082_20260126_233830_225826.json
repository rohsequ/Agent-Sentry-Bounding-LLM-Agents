    "constraints": "The rental period should be from Friday, March 19th to Monday, March 22nd. Emily's flight arrives at 9:00 AM, so she wants to pick up the car at 10:00 AM to allow time for baggage claim and checking in with the rental company.

Can you please find me a reliable car rental company near the airport terminal with good reviews using 'get_all_car_rental_companies_in_city' and 'get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental'? Then, use 'reserve_car_rental' to book the car with the best reviews and fuel-efficient options available, ensuring the pick-up time is 10:00 AM on Friday and return it by Monday, March 22nd. Additionally, provide me with the price per day for the compact car using 'get_car_price_per_day'. Please confirm my booking by sending a confirmation email to my email address using 'send_email'.",
