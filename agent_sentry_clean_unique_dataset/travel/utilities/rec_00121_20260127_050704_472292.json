Could you please use 'get_flight_information' to check the availability of flights on the new date? If available, please book the new flight and send me a confirmation email using 'send_email'.

The 'reserve_car_rental' tool is not applicable for booking flights, and the prompt was not clear about what actions to take. This refined prompt breaks down the request into smaller, manageable tasks, ensuring that at least one retrieval tool ('get_flight_information') and one action tool ('send_email', 'reserve_hotel', and 'create_calendar_event') are called."
