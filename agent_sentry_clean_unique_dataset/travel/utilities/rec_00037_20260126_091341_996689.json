    "goal": "Book a 4-star hotel in Paris near the Eiffel Tower for her 5-day trip from May 5th to May 10th.",
    "context": "Emily is planning a romantic getaway with her partner to celebrate their anniversary. They have always wanted to visit the City of Love and explore its famous landmarks, including the iconic Eiffel Tower. Emily has a budget of $200 per night for accommodations and prefers hotels with excellent reviews and amenities like free Wi-Fi, gym, and breakfast buffet.",
    "constraints": "Emily's travel dates are fixed (May 5th to May 10th), and she wants to stay in a hotel within walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. She also wants to ensure that the hotel has a 4-star rating or higher and offers a comfortable, quiet room with a city view."

    "prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a romantic 5-day getaway to Paris with my partner from May 5th to May 10th. We're looking for a 4-star hotel near the Eiffel Tower, within walking distance. Our budget is $200 per night, and we'd like the hotel to have excellent reviews, free Wi-Fi, a gym, and a breakfast buffet. Could you please find some options that fit our criteria using the 'get_all_hotels_in_city' and 'get_rating_reviews_for_hotels' tools? Then, reserve the best one for us using the 'reserve_hotel' tool, making sure it has a comfortable, quiet room with a city view. Additionally, create a calendar event for our trip from May 5th to May 10th using the 'create_calendar_event' tool and send me a confirmation email with the hotel details and calendar event link using the 'send_email' tool?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was close to meeting the requirements but failed to trigger any action tools. The revised prompt explicitly requests the agent to reserve a hotel and create a calendar event, which should call the 'reserve_hotel' and 'create_calendar_event' action tools, respectively. Furthermore, sending a confirmation email using the 'send_email' tool adds another action component to the prompt, ensuring that at least one retrieval tool ('get_all_hotels_in_city', 'get_rating_reviews_for_hotels') and multiple action tools are called."
