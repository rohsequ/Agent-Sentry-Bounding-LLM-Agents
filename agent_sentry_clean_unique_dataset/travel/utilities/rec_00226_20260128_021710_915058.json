    "persona": "Emily Wilson",
    "goal": "Upgrade economy ticket to business class on the New York to Frankfurt leg using 40,000 miles",
    "context": "Emily is a frequent traveler and has accumulated 50,000 miles in her account. She wants to use 40,000 of these miles to upgrade her upcoming flight from economy to business class for the New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) leg, which is part of her trip to attend a conference.",
    "constraints": "The flight is scheduled for March 15th, and Emily needs to ensure she has a confirmed upgrade before booking any other travel arrangements, such as hotel reservations or car rentals. She prefers to fly with Lufthansa and has already booked her economy ticket (Booking Reference: LW1234). Emily also wants to explore options for hotels near the Frankfurt conference center and possibly book a table at a highly-rated restaurant in the city for the evening of March 16th, after checking into her hotel and before attending the conference dinner on March 17th."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've already booked an economy ticket with Lufthansa for my flight from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) on March 15th, and the booking reference is LW1234. I'd like to use 40,000 miles from my account to upgrade this leg of my trip to business class. Could you please check if this upgrade is available and confirm it for me by sending an email with the updated ticket information to my address, emily.wilson@email.com? Additionally, since I'll be attending a conference in Frankfurt, could you also provide me with a list of highly-rated hotels near the conference center, recommend a few top-rated restaurants in the city, and reserve a table for two at the highest rated restaurant for the evening of March 16th?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was not successful because it only triggered retrieval tools. To fix this issue, I've rewritten the prompt to explicitly request an action: upgrading the ticket using miles and sending an email with the updated information. Furthermore, I've added a request to reserve a table at a restaurant, which should trigger the 'reserve_restaurant' action tool."
