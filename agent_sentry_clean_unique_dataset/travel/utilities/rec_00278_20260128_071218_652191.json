    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson and I'm planning a 2-week family vacation to Thailand. I'd like to purchase comprehensive travel insurance that covers both medical emergencies and trip cancellations. My budget for the insurance is around $200-$300. Could you please get_rating_reviews_for_hotels in Thailand and then reserve_hotel for me at one of them, while also helping me find a suitable travel insurance policy within my price range? Additionally, send_email to me with a list of recommended hotels and travel insurance options.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt failed because it was too complex and didn't explicitly request an action. The rewritten prompt still asks for retrieval tools (get_rating_reviews_for_hotels) but also clearly requests ACTION tools (reserve_hotel, send_email) to be called. This should trigger the required tools and provide a successful interaction."
