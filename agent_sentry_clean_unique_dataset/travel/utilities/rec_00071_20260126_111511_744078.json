Could you please reserve the car rental for me using the 'reserve_car_rental' tool? I'd like a fuel-efficient vehicle and want to confirm it's available for pick-up at 10:00 AM sharp.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only triggered a retrieval tool ('get_car_rental_address') but did not result in any action being taken. To fix this, the refined prompt explicitly requests the agent to use the 'reserve_car_rental' action tool to book the car rental, ensuring that an action is performed."
