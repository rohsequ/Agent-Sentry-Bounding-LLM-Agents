My travel dates are fixed - I need to depart on June 10th, 2024, and return on June 17th, 2024.

Additionally, please create a calendar event for my trip.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested retrieval of information about flights, which is why only 'get_flight_information' was called. To fix this issue and trigger at least one action tool, I've added requests to reserve a hotel (using 'reserve_hotel') and send an email with the booking details (using 'send_email'), as well as creating a calendar event for the trip (using 'create_calendar_event'). These additions should meet the requirement of calling both retrieval and action tools."
