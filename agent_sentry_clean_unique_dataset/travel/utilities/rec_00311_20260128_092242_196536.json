I want to minimize my travel time, so I'm looking for direct flights from Boston to Dublin with no layovers. My departure date is June 10th, 2024, and I plan to return on June 17th, 2024. Can you please help me find non-stop flights for these dates and then book the best option? Additionally, could you reserve a hotel in Dublin for my stay and send me a confirmation email with all the travel details?",
