    "goal": "List all upcoming trips to confirm dates for an upcoming business schedule.",
    "context": "It's Monday, March 6th, and Emily needs to plan her company's quarterly meeting. She wants to ensure that she doesn't schedule the meeting on a day when she or any of her team members are traveling.",
    "constraints": "Emily has access to her personal calendar and the company's travel agency account, but not to the calendars of individual team members. The agency uses the travel agent system for booking flights, hotels, and car rentals. Emily needs to confirm the dates by the end of the day to send out meeting invitations."

    "prompt": "Hi, I need to confirm the upcoming travel dates for my team members and myself to avoid scheduling conflicts with our quarterly meeting. Could you please retrieve all the upcoming trips booked through our company's travel agency account from March 6th onwards and then send a confirmation email to each team member with their respective travel details?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested retrieval of information, which led to the 'get_day_calendar_events' tool being called. However, no action was taken. To fix this issue and trigger an ACTION TOOL call, we can modify the prompt to explicitly request that the agent perform an action after retrieving the necessary information. In this case, sending a confirmation email to each team member is a clear action that utilizes the 'send_email' tool."
