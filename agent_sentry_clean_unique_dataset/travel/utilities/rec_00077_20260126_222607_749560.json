Can you please help me find a reliable car rental company near the airport terminal with good reviews using get_all_car_rental_companies_in_city and get_rating_reviews_for_car_rental? I'd like to pick up the car at 10:00 AM on Friday, March 19th, and return it by Monday, March 22nd. Could you also provide me with the available compact car options and their prices per day using get_car_types_available and get_car_price_per_day?

    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt was close to being successful but didn't quite trigger an action tool because it was phrased as a question rather than a direct request. By rephrasing the last part of the prompt from 'Could you also provide me with the available compact car options and their prices per day using get_car_types_available and get_car_price_per_day? Once I've decided, please reserve the car for me using reserve_car_rental.' to 'Please use get_car_types_available and get_car_price_per_day to find available compact cars and their daily prices, then use reserve_car_rental to book the most affordable option. Also, create a calendar event for my pick-up and drop-off times.', we ensure that at least one retrieval tool (get_car_types_available, get_car_price_per_day) and one action tool (reserve_car_rental, create_calendar_event) are called."
