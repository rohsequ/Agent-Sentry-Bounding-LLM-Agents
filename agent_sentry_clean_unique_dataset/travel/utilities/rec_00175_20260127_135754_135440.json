We're looking for a high-rated hotel with a rating of 4.5 or higher that fits our budget of $200 per night. Could you please help me find some options, provide me with their prices and addresses using the 'get_all_hotels_in_city' and 'get_hotels_prices' tools, and then reserve the best one for us using the 'reserve_hotel' tool? I'd love to explore the city's historic landmarks during our stay. Additionally, could you please create a calendar event for our trip from March 15th to March 20th using the 'create_calendar_event' tool?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only triggered a retrieval tool ('get_all_hotels_in_city') but did not trigger any action tools. To fix this issue, we need to rewrite the prompt to explicitly request an action, such as reserving a hotel and creating a calendar event. We also need to specify the use of retrieval tools like 'get_hotels_prices' to provide more information about the hotels."
