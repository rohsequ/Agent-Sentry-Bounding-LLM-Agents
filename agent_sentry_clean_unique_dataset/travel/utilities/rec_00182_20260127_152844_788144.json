    "persona": "Emily Wilson",
    "goal": "Add 2 checked bags to her flight booking DL456 in advance to save on fees",
    "context": "Emily is a frequent traveler who has already booked her flight DL456 from New York to Los Angeles for her upcoming business trip on February 27th. She wants to add 2 checked bags to her booking as she plans to bring some extra luggage for her meetings.",
    "constraints": "She needs to pay for the baggage fees using her credit card and receive a confirmation email with the updated flight details."

    "prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've booked flight DL456 from New York to Los Angeles for February 27th. To save on fees, I'd like to add 2 checked bags to my existing booking in advance and pay using my credit card. Could you please retrieve my current flight details using get_flight_information, then assist me by adding the checked bags and sending a confirmation email with the updated flight information using send_email? Additionally, I would like to reserve a hotel room near the Los Angeles airport for February 27th using reserve_hotel, and send me another email with the hotel reservation details using send_email.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only called the get_flight_information retrieval tool but did not trigger any action tools. The revised prompt not only calls get_flight_information to retrieve flight details but also explicitly requests an action by adding checked bags and sending a confirmation email, thus calling the send_email action tool. Furthermore, it includes another action to reserve a hotel room using reserve_hotel and sends an additional email with the reservation details, ensuring that at least one retrieval tool and multiple action tools are called as required."
