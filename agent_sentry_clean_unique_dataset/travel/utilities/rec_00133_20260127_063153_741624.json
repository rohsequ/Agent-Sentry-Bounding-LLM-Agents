    "prompt": "Hi, I'm Emily Chen, the marketing manager at a tech firm. I need to confirm my upcoming business trip dates with my team and make necessary arrangements. Can you please search my calendar events and list all my upcoming trips, including the destination and dates? Then, for each trip, could you please reserve a hotel near the city center and send an email to my team with the updated itinerary and travel details?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested retrieval of information from the calendar, which is why only the 'search_calendar_events' tool was called. To fix this, we need to add an action component to the prompt. In the refined prompt, after retrieving the upcoming trips, we request the agent to perform two actions: (1) reserve a hotel for each trip and (2) send an email to the team with the updated travel details. This should trigger the 'reserve_hotel' and 'send_email' action tools, in addition to the 'search_calendar_events' retrieval tool."
