    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only triggered a retrieval tool ('search_calendar_events') but didn't result in any action being taken. The revised prompt asks the agent to not only search for calendar events (retrieval) but also to take an action by sending an email to the airline to cancel the flight (action). This should trigger both 'get_day_calendar_events' (or 'search_calendar_events') and 'send_email' tools, meeting the requirement of calling at least one retrieval tool and one action tool."
