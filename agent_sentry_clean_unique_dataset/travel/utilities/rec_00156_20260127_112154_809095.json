Can you please help me search for flights within my budget using get_flight_information? Once you've found some affordable options, could you reserve a hotel with a rating of 4 or above for me using reserve_hotel? I'd also appreciate it if you could send me an email with the flight and hotel details using send_email.

The revised prompt explicitly requests the agent to search for flights, reserve a hotel, and send an email, which should call the required action tools (reserve_hotel and send_email) in addition to the retrieval tools (get_flight_information and get_all_hotels_in_city)."
