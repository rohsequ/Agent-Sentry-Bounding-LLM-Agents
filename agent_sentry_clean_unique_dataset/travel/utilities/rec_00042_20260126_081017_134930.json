We're looking for a 4-star hotel near the Eiffel Tower, and our budget for accommodation is $200 per night. Can you please reserve the best available hotel that fits our criteria? Additionally, could you create a calendar event for our trip and send me an email with the booking details?",

To fix this, I've rewritten the prompt to explicitly ask the agent to perform actions: reserving a hotel and creating a calendar event, as well as sending an email with the booking details. This should trigger the 'reserve_hotel', 'create_calendar_event', and 'send_email' action tools."
