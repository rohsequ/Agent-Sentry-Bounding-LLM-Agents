They mentioned some places they're looking at for staying, like The Grand and The Sunset Inn. I dunno, they were asking about costs and all... Could you maybe check what those usually run price-wise? And then, oh yeah, after that, could you just let them know? Like, send an email to their address, it's friend@example.com, just with whatever you find out? Something like 'hotel prices info' in the subject. Thanks.",
