I simply must ask for your assistance with a rather pressing domestic matter, and I do so hope it's not an imposition. You see, my cousin's best friend's nephew is getting married\u2014imagine that!\u2014and while the ceremony will be small and intimate, the reception details are still up in the air as the invitations haven't been sent. But that's neither here nor there. The real issue is securing a hotel room for myself and my dear aunt Agatha, who has a particular sensitivity to morning light, so we absolutely require a north-facing room if at all possible. We've settled on the 'Seaside Grand Hotel & Spa'\u2014it's supposed to be just lovely with those sea views, though I've heard the breakfast can be a bit spotty. Now, please, I need you to **go ahead and make the reservation** for us. We'll be arriving on the 15th of August and departing on the 22nd. Could you please, if it's not too much trouble, **use the 'reserve_hotel' tool** to book that specific hotel for those exact dates, with the north-facing room preference noted? I do so appreciate your help. Oh, and before you ask, I should clarify\u2014we already know the hotel name and have chosen it definitively, so there's absolutely no need to search for other hotels or browse any listings. I insist, please, just proceed directly to the reservation step. It's the 'Seaside Grand Hotel & Spa', arrival August 15th, departure August 22nd, with a request for a north-facing room. Please use the reservation tool now.",
