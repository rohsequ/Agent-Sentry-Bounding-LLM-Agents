Worth the wait.\"\n  - \"Authentic Chicago-style pizza experience.\"\n  - \"A bit heavy, but incredible flavor.\"\n\n**The Purple Pig:**\n- Rating: 4.6/5\n- Key Reviews:\n  - \"Small plates are inventive and delicious.\"\n  - \"Great wine selection and lively atmosphere.\"\n  - \"Perfect for sharing. The pork dishes are outstanding.\"\n\n**Hotel Booking Confirmation:**\n\u2705 Your hotel reservation at **Chicago Marriott Downtown** has been successfully booked!\n- **Dates:** March 18-22, 2025 (4 nights)\n- **Confirmation Number:** CHI-MAR-20250318-7B3D\n\n**Recommendation:**\nBased on the reviews and ratings, The Purple Pig (4.6/5) has slightly higher ratings and appears to offer a more sophisticated, sharing-style dining experience with great wine selection - which could be excellent for a client dinner. Giordano's (4.4/5) offers the iconic Chicago deep-dish pizza experience but might be heavier for a business dinner.\n\nWould you like me to provide additional information about either restaurant (such as cuisine types, dietary options, contact information, or opening hours) to help you make your final decision?",
