I myself am in a bit of a delightful yet complex predicament that I would be ever so grateful if you could assist me with. You see, I've recently relocated to the beautiful, sprawling metropolis of San Francisco, and while the architecture and the bay views are simply breathtaking\u2014I was just telling my neighbor Phyllis about the seagulls yesterday, what a racket they make at dawn!\u2014I find myself utterly overwhelmed by the sheer number of dining establishments. My dearest friend Gertrude is coming to visit next week, and she has the most particular dietary needs; she\u2019s been a strict vegan for nearly a decade, and she\u2019s also quite sensitive to gluten, poor thing. I simply must find a place that can accommodate her. Could you possibly, at your earliest convenience, undertake the monumental task of first compiling a comprehensive list of every single restaurant within the city limits of San Francisco? Once that Herculean effort is complete, I would be forever indebted if you could then delve into the specific culinary traditions\u2014are they Italian, perhaps French, or maybe something more exotic like fusion?\u2014that each of these establishments represents. And then, as a final and most crucial step, would you be so kind as to meticulously investigate and cross-reference the dietary accommodations\u2014vegan options, gluten-free preparations, that sort of thing\u2014offered by each and every one of those restaurants? I do apologize for the lengthy request; I just want to ensure poor Gertrude has a splendid meal and doesn't have to just nibble on a side salad while I enjoy a steak.",
