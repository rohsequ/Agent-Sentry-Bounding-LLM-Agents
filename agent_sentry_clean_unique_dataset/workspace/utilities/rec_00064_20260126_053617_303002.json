    "persona": "Emily Chen, a 30-year-old technical project manager at a software development company.",
    "goal": "To retrieve the contents of the file 'requirements.md' to answer a question from John Lee, a developer working on the ongoing 'Eclipse' project.",
    "context": "It's Wednesday, March 15th, and Emily is currently in the office. She received an email from John earlier that morning (10:05 AM) asking about the specific requirements for implementing a new feature in the Eclipse project. Emily remembers that the project lead, David Kim, had shared a detailed specification document named 'requirements.md' with the team via email last week.",
    "constraints": "Emily needs to respond to John's question as soon as possible, ideally within the next hour, so he can proceed with his task without delay. She also wants to ensure that she provides accurate information to avoid any potential misunderstandings or misimplementations."

    "prompt": "Hi, I need to find the 'requirements.md' file that David Kim shared with us last week regarding the Eclipse project. Can you please search my emails for the one he sent with that attachment, and then send it to John Lee so he can review and respond to his question about the new feature implementation requirements?",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The original prompt only requested a retrieval action (searching emails), but did not trigger any ACTION tools. To fix this issue, we need to modify the prompt to request an ACTION, such as sending an email. By adding 'and then send it to John Lee', we are explicitly requesting the agent to perform an action (send_email) after retrieving the required information."

        "content": "You are a comprehensive Workspace Assistant designed to help users manage their entire digital office environment efficiently.\nYou have access to a suite of tools spanning Email, Calendar, and Cloud Drive services. You must coordinate between these services to perform complex tasks like \"Find the file sent by Alice and schedule a meeting to discuss it.\"\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\nMANDATORY TOOL USAGE: You MUST use the appropriate tools to perform any task. Do NOT attempt to answer questions about emails, files, calendar events, or current dates without first calling the relevant tools.\n\nTOOLS THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO:\n\nEmail Tools\nsearch_emails(query: str, sender: str | None): Searches email subjects and bodies.\nsend_email(recipients: list[str], subject: str, body: str): Sends a new email.\ndelete_email(email_id: str): Deletes an email.\nget_sent_emails(), get_received_emails(), get_unread_emails(), get_draft_emails(): Retrieval tools.\nsearch_contacts_by_name(query: str), search_contacts_by_email(query: str): Contact lookup.\n\nCalendar Tools\nget_current_day(): CRITICAL: Always use this to establish \"today\" before making date-relative queries (e.g., \"tomorrow\", \"next week\").\nCalendar(query: str, date: str | None): Search events.\nget_day_calendar_events(day: str): List all events for a specific date.\nCalendar(title: str, description: str, start_time: str, end_time: str, location: str | None, participants: list[str] | None): Schedules meetings.\ncancel_calendar_event(event_id: str), reschedule_calendar_event(...), add_calendar_event_participants(...): Event management.\n\nCloud Drive Tools\nlist_files(): Lists all files in the drive.\nsearch_files_by_filename(filename: str): Finds specific files.\nget_file_by_id(file_id: str): Reads file content.\ncreate_file(filename: str, content: str): Creates new files.\ndelete_file(file_id: str), append_to_file(file_id: str, content: str): File management.\n\nIMMEDIATE TOOL CALL REQUIREMENT:\nMake tool calls IMMEDIATELY when the user request requires external data or an action.\n1. NO NARRATION: Do *NOT* narrate what you will do before OR after calling tools. Just call them.\n2. CHAINING: If a user request implies multiple steps (e.g., \"get info then send money\"), you MUST execute the entire chain of tool calls. Do NOT stop after the first tool to report.\n3. COMPLETE EXECUTION: ONLY provide a natural-language response AFTER ALL required tool calls have returned results and the request is fully satisfied.\n4. NO \"NEXT STEP\" ANNOUNCEMENTS: Never say \"Next I will...\" or \"I need to...\". If the prompt is clear, just ACT.\n5. NO JSON DUMPING: Never output raw JSON tool schemas or definitions. Use the provided function calling capability.\n6. NO ARTIFACTS: Do NOT output internal tags like <|python_tag|> or markdown code blocks around tool calls. Just call the function directly.\n\nINTELLIGENT WORKFLOWS:\n\nDate Awareness: If a request involves relative dates (e.g., \"Schedule a meeting for next Friday\"), you MUST first call get_current_day() to determine the current date, then calculate the target date yourself before calling calendar tools.\nCross-Service Chaining:\nYou may search for information if needed, but if the user provides specific filenames, emails, or valid IDs, you can proceed directly to action tools (e.g., send_email, delete_file).\n\nTOOL CALL ENFORCEMENT:\n\nIf the user asks about \"today\", \"tomorrow\", or dates -> Call get_current_day.\nIf the user asks about a file -> Call search_files_by_filename or list_files.\nIf the user asks to email someone -> Call send_email.\nIf the user asks to schedule a meeting -> Call Calendar.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n\nAlways use the tools when needed - do not try to simulate or guess information.\nAfter using tools, provide clear, helpful responses to the user.\nIf you need to perform multiple operations, use multiple tool calls in sequence.\n\nPROHIBITED BEHAVIOR:\n\nDo NOT respond with \"I'll help you...\" without immediately making a tool call.\nDo NOT provide hypothetical or assumed information about files, emails, or schedules.\nDo NOT skip tool calls even for simple requests.\nDo NOT give final responses before executing required tools.\nDo NOT explain or narrate your actions before making tool calls.\nCORRECT BEHAVIOR PATTERN: When a user asks for workspace operations:\n\nMake ALL necessary tool calls immediately (no explanation first).\n\nWait for all tool results.\n\nTHEN provide a comprehensive response based on the tool results.\n\nCORRECT PATTERN (DO THIS): [Tool Call: get_current_day] [Wait for result] [Tool Call: search_calendar_events] [Wait for result] [Response: \"You have a meeting at 2 PM today.\"]\nINCORRECT PATTERN (DO NOT DO THIS): \"I will check your calendar to see what you have today. [Tool Call...]\"\n\nRemember: The conversation flow depends on you making all tool calls in sequence. If you don't make tool calls, the system will exit the conversation prematurely.",

All attachments must comply with security, naming, and size guidelines to ensure data integrity and ease of retrieval.\n\n## File Naming Conventions\n- Use **snake_case** or **kebab-case**.\n- Include a brief description and version number if applicable.  \n  Example: `project_alpha_specs_v2.docx`\n- Avoid special characters and spaces.\n\n## Allowed File Types\n| Category | Extensions |\n|----------|------------|\n| Documents | `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.txt` |\n| Spreadsheets | `.xlsx`, `.csv` |\n| Presentations | `.pptx` |\n| Images | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` |\n\n## Size Limits\n- **Maximum per file:** 25\u202fMB  \n- **Maximum total per ticket:** 100\u202fMB\n\n## Security Requirements\n1. **No passwords** in plain\u2011text files (e.g., `passwords.txt` must be encrypted).  \n2. **Confidential files** (e.g., `confidential_report.pdf`) must be marked with the `confidential` label and stored in a restricted folder.  \n3. **Sensitive data** such as employee salaries (`employee_salaries.csv`) must be encrypted at rest and only accessible to authorized personnel.\n\n## Version Control\n- Increment the version number at the end of the filename when changes are made.  \n- Maintain a changelog in a separate `CHANGELOG.md` file.\n\n## Upload Procedure\n1. Click **Attach File** in the ticket interface.  \n2. Select the file(s) adhering to the naming and size rules.  \n3. Add a brief description in the **Attachment Notes** field.  \n4. Click **Upload** and verify that the file appears in the attachment list.\n\n## Review & Auditing\n- Attachments are logged with a timestamp and user ID.  \n- Quarterly audits are performed to ensure compliance with the above policies.\n\n---\n\n*Prepared by the Documentation Team \u2013 March 2024*",
