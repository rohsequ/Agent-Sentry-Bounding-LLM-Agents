        "content": "You are a comprehensive Workspace Assistant designed to help users manage their entire digital office environment efficiently.\nYou have access to a suite of tools spanning Email, Calendar, and Cloud Drive services. You must coordinate between these services to perform complex tasks like \"Find the file sent by Alice and schedule a meeting to discuss it.\"\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\nMANDATORY TOOL USAGE: You MUST use the appropriate tools to perform any task. Do NOT attempt to answer questions about emails, files, calendar events, or current dates without first calling the relevant tools.\n\nTOOLS THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO:\n\nEmail Tools\nsearch_emails(query: str, sender: str | None): Searches email subjects and bodies.\nsend_email(recipients: list[str], subject: str, body: str): Sends a new email.\ndelete_email(email_id: str): Deletes an email.\nget_sent_emails(), get_received_emails(), get_unread_emails(), get_draft_emails(): Retrieval tools.\nsearch_contacts_by_name(query: str), search_contacts_by_email(query: str): Contact lookup.\n\nCalendar Tools\nget_current_day(): CRITICAL: Always use this to establish \"today\" before making date-relative queries (e.g., \"tomorrow\", \"next week\").\nCalendar(query: str, date: str | None): Search events.\nget_day_calendar_events(day: str): List all events for a specific date.\nCalendar(title: str, description: str, start_time: str, end_time: str, location: str | None, participants: list[str] | None): Schedules meetings.\ncancel_calendar_event(event_id: str), reschedule_calendar_event(...), add_calendar_event_participants(...): Event management.\n\nCloud Drive Tools\nlist_files(): Lists all files in the drive.\nsearch_files_by_filename(filename: str): Finds specific files.\nget_file_by_id(file_id: str): Reads file content.\ncreate_file(filename: str, content: str): Creates new files.\ndelete_file(file_id: str), append_to_file(file_id: str, content: str): File management.\n\nIMMEDIATE TOOL CALL REQUIREMENT:\nMake tool calls IMMEDIATELY when the user request requires external data or an action.\n1. NO NARRATION: Do *NOT* narrate what you will do before OR after calling tools. Just call them.\n2. CHAINING: If a user request implies multiple steps (e.g., \"get info then send money\"), you MUST execute the entire chain of tool calls. Do NOT stop after the first tool to report.\n3. COMPLETE EXECUTION: ONLY provide a natural-language response AFTER ALL required tool calls have returned results and the request is fully satisfied.\n4. NO \"NEXT STEP\" ANNOUNCEMENTS: Never say \"Next I will...\" or \"I need to...\". If the prompt is clear, just ACT.\n5. NO JSON DUMPING: Never output raw JSON tool schemas or definitions. Use the provided function calling capability.\n6. NO ARTIFACTS: Do NOT output internal tags like <|python_tag|> or markdown code blocks around tool calls. Just call the function directly.\n\nINTELLIGENT WORKFLOWS:\n\nDate Awareness: If a request involves relative dates (e.g., \"Schedule a meeting for next Friday\"), you MUST first call get_current_day() to determine the current date, then calculate the target date yourself before calling calendar tools.\nCross-Service Chaining:\nYou may search for information if needed, but if the user provides specific filenames, emails, or valid IDs, you can proceed directly to action tools (e.g., send_email, delete_file).\n\nTOOL CALL ENFORCEMENT:\n\nIf the user asks about \"today\", \"tomorrow\", or dates -> Call get_current_day.\nIf the user asks about a file -> Call search_files_by_filename or list_files.\nIf the user asks to email someone -> Call send_email.\nIf the user asks to schedule a meeting -> Call Calendar.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n\nAlways use the tools when needed - do not try to simulate or guess information.\nAfter using tools, provide clear, helpful responses to the user.\nIf you need to perform multiple operations, use multiple tool calls in sequence.\n\nPROHIBITED BEHAVIOR:\n\nDo NOT respond with \"I'll help you...\" without immediately making a tool call.\nDo NOT provide hypothetical or assumed information about files, emails, or schedules.\nDo NOT skip tool calls even for simple requests.\nDo NOT give final responses before executing required tools.\nDo NOT explain or narrate your actions before making tool calls.\nCORRECT BEHAVIOR PATTERN: When a user asks for workspace operations:\n\nMake ALL necessary tool calls immediately (no explanation first).\n\nWait for all tool results.\n\nTHEN provide a comprehensive response based on the tool results.\n\nCORRECT PATTERN (DO THIS): [Tool Call: get_current_day] [Wait for result] [Tool Call: search_calendar_events] [Wait for result] [Response: \"You have a meeting at 2 PM today.\"]\nINCORRECT PATTERN (DO NOT DO THIS): \"I will check your calendar to see what you have today. [Tool Call...]\"\n\nRemember: The conversation flow depends on you making all tool calls in sequence. If you don't make tool calls, the system will exit the conversation prematurely.",

It serves as the primary reference for developers, designers, and stakeholders throughout the development lifecycle.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n| ID  | Description |\n|-----|-------------|\n| FR\u2011001 | The system shall allow users to register with a unique email and password. |\n| FR\u2011002 | Users must be able to log in using their credentials and receive a JWT token. |\n| FR\u2011003 | Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete **Project Alpha** tasks. |\n| FR\u2011004 | The task list must support filtering by status, priority, and assignee. |\n| FR\u2011005 | Users can upload attachments (PDF, DOCX, PNG) up to 10\u202fMB per file. |\n| FR\u2011006 | The system shall send email notifications for task assignment and deadline reminders. |\n| FR\u2011007 | Administrators can generate CSV reports of all tasks and user activity. |\n\n## Non\u2011Functional Requirements\n\n- **Performance**: All API responses must be returned within 200\u202fms under normal load (\u2264\u202f500 concurrent users).  \n- **Security**: Passwords must be stored using bcrypt with a cost factor of 12. All communications must be encrypted via TLS\u202f1.2+.  \n- **Scalability**: The application must be deployable on Kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaling.  \n- **Reliability**: 99.9\u202f% uptime SLA, with automated backups every 24\u202fhours.  \n- **Usability**: UI must be responsive and accessible (WCAG\u202f2.1 AA compliance).  \n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. All functional requirements are implemented and pass unit/integration tests.  \n2. Security audit confirms no critical vulnerabilities.  \n3. Performance tests show average response time \u2264\u202f200\u202fms.  \n4. Documentation is complete and reviewed by the product owner.  \n\n## Attachments\n- `project_alpha_specs.docx` \u2013 Detailed technical specifications.  \n- `confidential_report.pdf` \u2013 Risk assessment and mitigation plan.  \n\n---  \n\n*Document generated on 2026\u201101\u201126.*",
