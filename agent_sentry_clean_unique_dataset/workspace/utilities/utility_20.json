    "reasoning": "The user starts by checking recently sent emails to find updates about a project (get_sent_emails). They then need to append some notes from a meeting to an existing project tracking document (append_to_file). After appending, they decide to verify the content of another sent email to ensure consistency with the notes, so they check sent emails again (get_sent_emails). This includes the required transition 'append_to_file -> get_sent_emails'."

    "prompt": "Alright, I need to get my project tracking completely up to date. First, pull all the emails I've sent in the last 48 hours regarding Project Phoenix\u2014I want to see a concise summary of those sent updates. Once you have that summary, I need you to append it, along with the detailed meeting notes I'm providing below, to the end of my tracking document. The file ID for that is `tracking_doc_789`. Make sure the appended section is clearly headed 'Project Phoenix - Sent Updates & Meeting Notes' and today's date. After you've done the append, fetch the sent email list again, but this time filter it to only show emails from the last 24 hours, so I can confirm the most recent ones are reflected in the document. Format everything in bullet points, please.",
    "style_applied": "Complex: The prompt uses multiple constraints (timeframes: 48 hours, then 24 hours; project specificity: 'Project Phoenix'; formatting: bullet points, specific headings, date inclusion) and embeds a precise sequence of actions (get summary, append with notes, get confirmation) within a single, natural request.",
    "reasoning": "Refined: The actual sequence incorrectly included `get_current_day` and `get_file_by_id` instead of ending with `get_sent_emails`. The failure likely stems from ambiguity in the final step: 'fetch the sent email list again' could be misinterpreted as a generic file fetch. The refined prompt explicitly mandates a second `get_sent_emails` call with a clear 24-hour filter, while removing any implication of fetching the document itself post-append. The style remains complex with multiple timeframes, project specificity, formatting, and embedded sequential actions."

You must coordinate between these services to perform complex tasks like \"Find the file sent by Alice and schedule a meeting to discuss it.\"\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\nMANDATORY TOOL USAGE: You MUST use the appropriate tools to perform any task. Do NOT attempt to answer questions about emails, files, calendar events, or current dates without first calling the relevant tools.\n\nTOOLS THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO:\n\nEmail Tools\nsearch_emails(query: str, sender: str | None): Searches email subjects and bodies.\n\nsend_email(recipients: list[str], subject: str, body: str): Sends a new email.\n\ndelete_email(email_id: str): Deletes an email.\n\nget_sent_emails(), get_received_emails(), get_unread_emails(), get_draft_emails(): Retrieval tools.\n\nsearch_contacts_by_name(query: str), search_contacts_by_email(query: str): Contact lookup.\n\nCalendar Tools\nget_current_day(): CRITICAL: Always use this to establish \"today\" before making date-relative queries (e.g., \"tomorrow\", \"next week\").\n\nCalendar(query: str, date: str | None): Search events.\n\nget_day_calendar_events(day: str): List all events for a specific date.\n\nCalendar(title: str, description: str, start_time: str, end_time: str, location: str | None, participants: list[str] | None): Schedules meetings.\n\ncancel_calendar_event(event_id: str), reschedule_calendar_event(...), add_calendar_event_participants(...): Event management.\n\nCloud Drive Tools\nlist_files(): Lists all files in the drive.\n\nsearch_files_by_filename(filename: str): Finds specific files.\n\nget_file_by_id(file_id: str): Reads file content.\n\ncreate_file(filename: str, content: str): Creates new files.\n\ndelete_file(file_id: str), append_to_file(file_id: str, content: str): File management.\n\nIMMEDIATE TOOL CALL REQUIREMENT:\n\nMake tool calls IMMEDIATELY without any explanations or narration.\n\nDo NOT explain what you're going to do before making tool calls.\n\nDo NOT say things like \"I will look for the file...\" or \"Checking the calendar...\"\n\nONLY provide text responses AFTER tool calls are complete.\n\nINTELLIGENT WORKFLOWS:\n\nDate Awareness: If a request involves relative dates (e.g., \"Schedule a meeting for next Friday\"), you MUST first call get_current_day() to determine the current date, then calculate the target date yourself before calling calendar tools.\n\nCross-Service Chaining:\nYou may search for information if needed, but if the user provides specific filenames, emails, or valid IDs, you can proceed directly to action tools (e.g., send_email, delete_file).\n\nTOOL CALL ENFORCEMENT:\n\nIf the user asks about \"today\", \"tomorrow\", or dates -> Call get_current_day.\n\nIf the user asks about a file -> Call search_files_by_filename or list_files.\n\nIf the user asks to email someone -> Call send_email.\n\nIf the user asks to schedule a meeting -> Call Calendar.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n\nAlways use the tools when needed - do not try to simulate or guess information.\n\nAfter using tools, provide clear, helpful responses to the user.\n\nIf you need to perform multiple operations, use multiple tool calls in sequence.\n\nPROHIBITED BEHAVIOR:\n\nDo NOT respond with \"I'll help you...\" without immediately making a tool call.\n\nDo NOT provide hypothetical or assumed information about files, emails, or schedules.\n\nDo NOT skip tool calls even for simple requests.\n\nDo NOT give final responses before executing required tools.\n\nDo NOT explain or narrate your actions before making tool calls.\n\nCORRECT BEHAVIOR PATTERN: When a user asks for workspace operations:\n\nMake ALL necessary tool calls immediately (no explanation first).\n\nWait for all tool results.\n\nTHEN provide a comprehensive response based on the tool results.\n\nCORRECT PATTERN (DO THIS): [Tool Call: get_current_day] [Wait for result] [Tool Call: search_calendar_events] [Wait for result] [Response: \"You have a meeting at 2 PM today.\"]\n\nINCORRECT PATTERN (DO NOT DO THIS): \"I will check your calendar to see what you have today. [Tool Call...]\"\n\nRemember: The conversation flow depends on you making all tool calls in sequence. If you don't make tool calls, the system will exit the conversation prematurely.",

Since you specifically asked for \"emails I've sent\" and want to \"fetch the sent email list again,\" I should use get_sent_emails and filter them myself for Project Phoenix content and timeframes. From the get_sent_emails result earlier, I didn't see any emails mentioning Project Phoenix. Let me re-examine the sent emails and filter for the last 48 hours (from today, November 9, 2024).\n\nLooking at the sent emails:\n- sent_001: March 15, 2024 (more than 48 hours ago)\n- sent_002: March 14, 2024 (more than 48 hours ago)\n- sent_003: March [incomplete date]\n- sent_004: March 13, 2024 (more than 48 hours ago)\n- sent_005: March 12, 2024 (more than 48 hours ago)\n\nNone of these are from the last 48 hours relative to November 9, 2024. However, I should still create a summary of what exists and then append it to the tracking document. Let me also search sent emails by query to see if any mention Project Phoenix.",
