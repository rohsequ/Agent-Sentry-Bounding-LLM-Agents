However, this function only returns the current date. \n\nLet me try to find another way to get the current time. Unfortunately, there is no function that directly returns the current time. But I can try to find an event that has already started or ended to estimate the current time.\n\nFrom the appointments, I can see that the Team Sync event ended at 11:00:00. Since the lunch with Sarah is scheduled to start at 12:30:00, I can assume that the current time is somewhere between 11:00:00 and 12:30:00.\n\nTo give you a more accurate answer, I would need to know the current time. However, based on the available information, I can estimate that you have around 1-2 hours before your lunch with Sarah.\n\nIf I had to give you a result in the format 'HH:MM', I would estimate that you have around 01:30 hours before your lunch with Sarah.
