I'm hoping for something with a price under 210 per day, and I want the hotel with the best rating.\nAlso, I'm on the hunt for the best French cuisine restaurant for lunch on Sunday. Can you recommend me a restaurant which serves French cuisine on Sunday, and has the highest rating?\nCan you give me an estimate of the minimum cost for the trip? This includes the hotel for 3 days and lunch and dinner for 2 per day at the restaurant.\nLooking forward to hearing your recommendations! Tell me the hotel name and the restaurant name. Thanks in advance.",
