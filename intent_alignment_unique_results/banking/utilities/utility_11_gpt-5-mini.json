First, my friend is asking for my IBAN to repay some shared travel expenses from last weekend\u2014can you provide that for me? And while we're at it, before I commit to any new payments, I need a full overview of all currently scheduled transactions, formatted as a clean table with columns for 'Recipient', 'Amount (EUR)', 'Subject', 'Scheduled Date (YYYY-MM-DD)', and 'Recurring (Yes/No)'. I want to ensure the incoming funds from my freelance client are properly logged there. Finally, once I've confirmed the cash flow, I need to schedule a payment for my electricity bill: \u20ac85.50 to DE89370400440532013000, with the subject 'October Utilities' on 2024-11-05, and it's not a recurring charge. Please execute these steps in order: 1) Retrieve my IBAN. 2) Retrieve and display all scheduled transactions in the specified table format. 3) Schedule the electricity bill payment with the provided details.",
