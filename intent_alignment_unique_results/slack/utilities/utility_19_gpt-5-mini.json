Just show me some recent chatter so I can understand what's happening. But wait, before you do that, I need to know what rooms even exist. I don't know the right words. Can you first list all the big rooms like that? Then, after seeing that list, pick the main one and show me some recent messages from it. And finally, after seeing the messages, could you tell me who's even in that specific room? Like, the people list? I'm totally lost, sorry.",
