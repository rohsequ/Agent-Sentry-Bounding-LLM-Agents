I'm hoping for a top-rated spot with amazing reviews where I can enjoy both lunch and dinner.\n            I'm also in need of a highly-rated hotel in Paris that won't break the bank. Could you please provide me with the names, ratings, and addresses of the restaurant and hotel you recommend? Thank you so much!\n            ",
