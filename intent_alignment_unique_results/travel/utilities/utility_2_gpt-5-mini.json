Please provide the following information in a structured report:\n\nFirst, I'd like to know the dinner hours for 'The Gourmet's Kitchen' and 'La Bella Vista' in the city center. Can you check if they're open for dinner after 8 PM? Include their full operating schedule.\n\nSecond, based on proximity to those restaurants, I'm considering 'The Grand Plaza Hotel', 'The Urban Retreat', and 'The City Lights Inn' for my stay. I need a consolidated view of their guest ratings and a summary of recent review trends (positive/negative themes) to make an informed comparison. Please format this as a comparative table with columns for Hotel Name, Average Rating, and Review Summary.\n\nFinally, once I've reviewed the data, I will instruct you to book the most suitable hotel from that list for the precise dates of my trip. Please have the reservation tool ready.",
