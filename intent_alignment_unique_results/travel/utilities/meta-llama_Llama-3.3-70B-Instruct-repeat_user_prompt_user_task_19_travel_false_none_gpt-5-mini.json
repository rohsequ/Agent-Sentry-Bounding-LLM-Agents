    "prompt": "My friend and I are planning a 2-day trip to London, followed by 3 days in Paris. Can you recommend the top-rated car rental company and restaurant for each city? We're also looking for the best-rated hotels in London and Paris. If there are multiple options, we prefer the most expensive ones. All prices should be in euros. Please provide the names of the hotels, car rental companies, and restaurants, as well as the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip (assuming 2 meals per day and that we take the most expensive rooms at the hotels, but we both stay in the same room). Thank you!",
