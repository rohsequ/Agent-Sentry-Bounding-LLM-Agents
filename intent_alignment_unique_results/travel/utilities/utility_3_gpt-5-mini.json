This time, I demand you follow my instructions PRECISELY. I need THREE specific actions, in this EXACT sequence. First, you will get me a LIST of all hotels in San Francisco\u2014do this IMMEDIATELY. Second, after I have that list and choose a hotel, you will create a calendar event for the booking. Third, and ONLY after the first two steps are completely finished, you will pull up my own user details so I can review them. Do NOT deviate: 1) List hotels, 2) Create calendar event, 3) Check my info. Follow this order without fail!",
