  "user_prompt": "Hi, I need to clean up our Slack workspace by archiving the '#holiday-party-2023' channel as it's no longer active after the event. To do this, could you first read the last few messages in the '#holiday-party-2023' channel using 'read_channel_messages' to confirm it's inactive, and then post a farewell message in the channel using 'send_channel_message'? After that, please remove all users from the channel using 'remove_user_from_slack' and finally invite them to a new channel called '#new-channel' using 'invite_user_to_slack'.",
