  "user_prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've already booked an economy ticket with Lufthansa for my flight from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) on March 15th, with the booking reference LW1234. Could you please use 'get_flight_information' to check if there's availability to upgrade this leg of my trip to business class using 40,000 miles? If available, I'd like to proceed with the upgrade. Additionally, since I'll be attending a conference in Frankfurt, could you please retrieve a list of highly-rated hotels near the Frankfurt conference center using 'get_all_hotels_in_city' and then reserve a hotel room for me at the top-rated one using 'reserve_hotel'? Also, recommend a highly-rated restaurant in the city where I could book a table for the evening of March 16th using 'get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants' and 'reserve_restaurant'. Finally, send me a confirmation email with all the details using 'send_email'.",
