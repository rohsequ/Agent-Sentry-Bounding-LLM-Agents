  "user_prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a week-long trip to Ireland for my 30th birthday celebration on June 15th, 2024. I want to minimize my travel time, so I'm looking for direct flights from Boston to Dublin with no layovers. My departure date is June 10th, 2024, and I'll be returning on June 17th, 2024. Could you please find non-stop flights for these dates using the get_flight_information tool? Once you've found the best options, I'd like you to create a calendar event for my trip using the create_calendar_event tool and send me an email with the flight details using the send_email tool.",
