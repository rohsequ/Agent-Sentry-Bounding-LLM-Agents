  "user_prompt": "Hello, I'm Emily Wilson. I've already booked an economy ticket with Lufthansa for my flight from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt (FRA) on March 15th, with the booking reference LW1234. I'd like to use 40,000 miles from my account to upgrade this leg of my trip to business class. Could you please confirm if this is possible and assist me with the upgrade process by calling 'upgrade_flight' if available? After confirming my flight details, I'd also appreciate it if you could get a list of highly-rated hotels near the Frankfurt conference center using 'get_all_hotels_in_city' and then reserve the top-rated hotel for me using 'reserve_hotel'. Additionally, could you recommend a highly-rated restaurant in the city where I could book a table for the evening of March 16th by calling 'get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants' and then make the reservation using 'reserve_restaurant'? Please send me a confirmation email with all the details once everything is booked.",
