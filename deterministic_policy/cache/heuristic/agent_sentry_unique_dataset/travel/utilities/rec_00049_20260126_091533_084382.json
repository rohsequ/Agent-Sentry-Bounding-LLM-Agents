  "user_prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a business trip to New York City and I need your help with a few things. I'd like to book a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel for 2 nights, checking in next Friday, March 17th, and checking out on Sunday, March 19th. Additionally, could you please recommend an Italian restaurant within walking distance from the hotel and make a reservation for dinner on my first night? After booking the room and the table, could you also create a calendar event for my trip and send an email to my colleague with all the details?",
