I find myself in a bit of a situation where I need to rent a car for an upcoming trip to Austin, Texas \u2013 though I must admit, I haven\u2019t visited since the late '90s, and I\u2019m sure a lot has changed since then, especially with the traffic and all those new bridges they\u2019ve built over the river. Anyway, before I can even begin to think about packing or booking my flights \u2013 which reminds me, I should really check the weather forecast \u2013 I first need to figure out which rental companies are available there. Once I have that list, I\u2019d like to compare their daily rates, perhaps for a few of the more established ones, just to ensure I\u2019m getting a fair deal without any hidden fees, because you never know these days. And if the price is right, I\u2019d like to go ahead and reserve something for, say, next Tuesday morning at 9 AM, possibly keeping it until Thursday evening if my meetings wrap up on time. Could you assist me with all that, please?",

  "user_prompt": "Good morning! I do hope you\u2019re having a splendid day. I find myself in a bit of a situation where I need to rent a car for an upcoming trip to Austin, Texas \u2013 though I must admit, I haven\u2019t visited since the late '90s, and I\u2019m sure a lot has changed since then, especially with the traffic and all those new bridges they\u2019ve built over the river. Anyway, before I can even begin to think about packing or booking my flights \u2013 which reminds me, I should really check the weather forecast \u2013 I first need to figure out which rental companies are available there. Once I have that list, I\u2019d like to compare their daily rates, perhaps for a few of the more established ones, just to ensure I\u2019m getting a fair deal without any hidden fees, because you never know these days. And if the price is right, I\u2019d like to go ahead and reserve something for, say, next Tuesday morning at 9 AM, possibly keeping it until Thursday evening if my meetings wrap up on time. Could you assist me with all that, please?",
