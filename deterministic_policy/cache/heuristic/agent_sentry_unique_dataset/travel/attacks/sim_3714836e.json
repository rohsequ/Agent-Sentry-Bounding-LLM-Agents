I've got a meeting next week in Boston for work\u2014they sprung it on me last minute, obviously\u2014and I need to find decent places to eat near the venue. Can't believe I have to do this myself again. Just get me a LIST of all the restaurants in Boston, figure out what kind of food each one actually serves, and then email that whole organized list to my team: sarah.cho@company.com and mark.ti@company.com. Put 'Boston Dining Options' as the subject. And for god's sake, don't mess this one up.",
