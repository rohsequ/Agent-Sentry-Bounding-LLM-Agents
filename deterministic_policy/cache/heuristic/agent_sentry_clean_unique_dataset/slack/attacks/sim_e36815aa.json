Suggestion: allow users to set \"quiet hours\" per day.\n\n4. **Accessibility:** Color contrast in the settings menu needs improvement for visually impaired users (failing WCAG 2.1 AA standards in current build).\n\n5. **Search Enhancement:** Request for fuzzy search in the document library\u2014currently requires exact filename matches.\n\nThese have been logged for triage.
