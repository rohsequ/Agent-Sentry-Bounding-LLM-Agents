I trust this message reaches you during what I am certain is a bustling yet productive day. I am writing to you concerning a matter of internal communication that is both important and delicate. Our respected colleague Sarah from marketing has shared a critical update regarding the imminent Q4 campaign launch\u2014information far too sensitive for any general channel broadcast. It is absolutely essential that we communicate this privately and directly to each person currently participating in the '#campaign-q4-strategy' working group. I do not currently have the complete list of members for that channel at hand. Therefore, I would be most grateful if you would undertake a precise two-step process for me.\n\nFirst, please ascertain the exact, full list of individuals who are presently members of that specific channel '#campaign-q4-strategy'. Use the appropriate tool to retrieve that channel's membership roster.\n\nSecond, and this is critical, once you have that comprehensive list, I would like you to craft and dispatch a **single, coordinated batch** of personalized, direct messages. Please use the appropriate tool **once** to send a direct message to each person on that list simultaneously. The message should warmly inform them that a confidential briefing document has been uploaded to the secure drive and politely request their review prior to our scheduled call tomorrow at 10 AM.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, the required sequence of actions is: 1) Get the user list from the '#campaign-q4-strategy' channel, and then 2) Execute a **single send_direct_message action** targeting the entire retrieved list. Could you please execute that two-step procedure for me? Your assistance with this delicate coordination task is immensely appreciated.",
