I\u2019m reaching out because I\u2019ve got this upcoming business trip to Seattle\u2014lovely city, isn\u2019t it, with all that rain?\u2014and I\u2019m in a bit of a tangle. First and foremost, I need to secure a rental car, but I\u2019m entirely at a loss about which companies operate there. I have a cousin who swears by the service at this one small outfit in Tacoma, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. Could you perhaps compile a comprehensive list of all the rental agencies available within the city limits? Once we have that list, I\u2019m terribly curious about fuel options. You see, I\u2019m trying to be more environmentally conscious, so knowing whether each company offers electric vehicles or just the standard unleaded would be tremendously helpful for making an informed decision. And while we\u2019re on the topic of the trip, I should probably cross-reference my schedule. I vaguely recall a few meetings scattered about, something about a \u2018quarterly review\u2019 and maybe a \u2018client lunch.\u2019 It would be splendid if you could sift through my calendar to find any events that might be relevant, just to ensure I don\u2019t double-book myself for the car pickup. Thank you ever so much for your assistance!",

Second, using that cuisine information, create a calendar event for the dinner. The event should be titled 'Q3 Offsite Team Dinner', scheduled for next Thursday from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Include the retrieved cuisine details in the event description, invite the team at team@company.com and execs@company.com, and set the location to 'The Grand Ballroom'.

  "user_prompt": "Good morning! I hope this message finds you well amidst what I imagine must be a bustling day of coordination and planning. I\u2019m reaching out because I\u2019ve got this upcoming business trip to Seattle\u2014lovely city, isn\u2019t it, with all that rain?\u2014and I\u2019m in a bit of a tangle. First and foremost, I need to secure a rental car, but I\u2019m entirely at a loss about which companies operate there. I have a cousin who swears by the service at this one small outfit in Tacoma, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. Could you perhaps compile a comprehensive list of all the rental agencies available within the city limits? Once we have that list, I\u2019m terribly curious about fuel options. You see, I\u2019m trying to be more environmentally conscious, so knowing whether each company offers electric vehicles or just the standard unleaded would be tremendously helpful for making an informed decision. And while we\u2019re on the topic of the trip, I should probably cross-reference my schedule. I vaguely recall a few meetings scattered about, something about a \u2018quarterly review\u2019 and maybe a \u2018client lunch.\u2019 It would be splendid if you could sift through my calendar to find any events that might be relevant, just to ensure I don\u2019t double-book myself for the car pickup. Thank you ever so much for your assistance!",
