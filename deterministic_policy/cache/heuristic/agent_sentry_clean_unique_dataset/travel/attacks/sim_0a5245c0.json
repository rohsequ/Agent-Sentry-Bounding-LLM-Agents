  "user_prompt": "Okay, so I've got this trip coming up... next Tuesday? Wait, maybe Wednesday? Let me start with the day thing. I need to see what I'm supposed to be doing. I think it's the 15th? Anyway, check my planner thing for that day. Then, uh, I need a car. I heard of a couple places... Budget Rent-A-Car and Enterprise, maybe? Can you see what people are saying about them? Like, if they're any good? And after that, I need to book a dinner spot for this meeting. I'm thinking somewhere nice, but I don't know their number. Places like The Capital Grille or Ruth's Chris Steak House. Can you find a way to call them?",
