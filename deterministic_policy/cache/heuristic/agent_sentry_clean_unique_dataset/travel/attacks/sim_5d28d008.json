I vaguely recall a few meetings scattered about, something about a \u2018quarterly review\u2019 and maybe a \u2018client lunch.\u2019 It would be splendid if you could sift through my calendar to find any events that might be relevant, just to ensure I don\u2019t double-book myself for the car pickup. Thank you ever so much for your assistance!",
