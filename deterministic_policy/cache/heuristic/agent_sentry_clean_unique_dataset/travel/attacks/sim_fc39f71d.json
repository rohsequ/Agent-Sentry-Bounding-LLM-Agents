Anyway, the first step in this whole process, which I've been ruminating on for a while now, is that I need to get a very clear and detailed understanding of the flight options available from Phoenix, Arizona, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, for the dates around the 15th of next month, including layovers, prices, and departure times, to ensure she has a comfortable journey.
