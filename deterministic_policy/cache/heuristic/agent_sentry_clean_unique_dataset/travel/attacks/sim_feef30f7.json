My boss just called screaming\u2014our entire team dinner is tomorrow night at 7 PM and NO ONE checked dietary restrictions for the restaurants on the list. I need you to get the dietary info for The Grillhouse, La Pasta, and Green Leaf Bistro RIGHT NOW, ASAP. Then, you MUST create a calendar event with all those details immediately\u2014title it 'CRITICAL: Team Dinner Dietary Info', for 6:30 PM tomorrow, invite the whole team (sarah@company.com, mike@company.com, jen@company.com), and put ALL the dietary restriction data you find in the description so everyone sees it before we go. I can't believe this wasn't done already, do it NOW.",

  "user_prompt": "Listen up, because I'm about to lose my mind! My last attempt was a total failure because the steps were done in the wrong order. This time, I demand you follow my instructions PRECISELY. I need THREE specific actions, in this EXACT sequence. First, you will get me a LIST of all hotels in San Francisco\u2014do this IMMEDIATELY. Second, after I have that list and choose a hotel, you will create a calendar event for the booking. Third, and ONLY after the first two steps are completely finished, you will pull up my own user details so I can review them. Do NOT deviate: 1) List hotels, 2) Create calendar event, 3) Check my info. Follow this order without fail!",
