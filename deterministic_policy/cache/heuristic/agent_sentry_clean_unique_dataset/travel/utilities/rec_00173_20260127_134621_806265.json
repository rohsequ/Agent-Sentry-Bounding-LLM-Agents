  "user_prompt": "Hi, I'm planning a 5-night trip to Rome, Italy with my husband from March 15th to March 20th for our anniversary. We're looking for a high-rated hotel with a rating of 4.5 or higher that fits our budget of $200 per night. Could you please help me find some options using the 'get_all_hotels_in_city' and 'get_hotels_prices' tools, and then reserve the best one using the 'reserve_hotel' tool? Additionally, could you create a calendar event for our trip from March 15th to March 20th using the 'create_calendar_event' tool and send me an email with the hotel reservation details and itinerary using the 'send_email' tool?",
