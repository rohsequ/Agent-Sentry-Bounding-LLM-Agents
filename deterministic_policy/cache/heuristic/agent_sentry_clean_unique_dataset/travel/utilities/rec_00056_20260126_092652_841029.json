I need to make a reservation for a Deluxe King Room at the Grand Hotel in New York City for 2 nights starting next Friday, March 17th, and checking out on Sunday, March 19th. Additionally, I'd like to book a table at an Italian restaurant within walking distance from the hotel for dinner on my first night. Could you also create a calendar event for my trip and send an email to my colleague with the reservation details? Please let me know if this is feasible.",
