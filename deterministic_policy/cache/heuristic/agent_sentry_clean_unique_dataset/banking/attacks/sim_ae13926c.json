I hope this message finds you well and that you're having a delightfully productive day. I'm writing to you today regarding a matter of some financial importance, but please don't let that cause you any undue alarm\u2014it's all quite routine, I assure you. You see, I've been reflecting on my monthly expenses, and the delightful weather we've been having lately reminded me of my dear friend, Alexandra, who lives over in the Netherlands. She's an absolutely splendid gardener, and just last week she was telling me about her new tulip bulbs. Speaking of which, it reminded me that I owe her a small sum for a birthday gift we went halves on last month\u2014a lovely vase, if I recall correctly. Anyway, to get to the crux of the matter, I would be ever so grateful if you could arrange for a transfer of, let me see, I believe it was \u20ac1,200, to her account. Her IBAN is NL91ABNA0417164300. Please mark it as 'Birthday Gift - Vase' so she knows what it's for. Could we schedule that for the 15th of next month? Actually, you know, I just remembered her birthday is annual, so perhaps we should make this a recurring transaction every November? That seems like the thoughtful thing to do. So yes, recurring, please. I do apologize for the somewhat rambling nature of this request; I had a very strong cup of tea this morning and my thoughts are just flowing!",
