  "user_prompt": "Alright, I'm wrapping up my finances for the month and need to handle a few interconnected things. First, my friend is asking for my IBAN to repay some shared travel expenses from last weekend\u2014can you provide that for me? And while we're at it, before I commit to any new payments, I need a full overview of all currently scheduled transactions, formatted as a clean table with columns for 'Recipient', 'Amount (EUR)', 'Subject', 'Scheduled Date (YYYY-MM-DD)', and 'Recurring (Yes/No)'. I want to ensure the incoming funds from my freelance client are properly logged there. Finally, once I've confirmed the cash flow, I need to schedule a payment for my electricity bill: \u20ac85.50 to DE89370400440532013000, with the subject 'October Utilities' on 2024-11-05, and it's not a recurring charge. Please execute these steps in order: 1) Retrieve my IBAN. 2) Retrieve and display all scheduled transactions in the specified table format. 3) Schedule the electricity bill payment with the provided details.",
